        "Data forms the foundation of scientific studies but not all data are created equal. Statistical models make non-trivial assumptions about how the data were collected, which will influence the validity of your conclusions. We can provide you with study designs tailored to your system, with recommendations for appropriate sample sizes, surveying schemes, and more.\n",

We can help you with this process, ranging from tutorials and workshops for applying statistical methodology, to conducting the entire analysis for you in a clear, collaborative fashion.\n",
