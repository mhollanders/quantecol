[Jon-Paul Emery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rdDO8HUAAAAJ&hl=en) and colleagues conducted experimental releases of the Extinct in the Wild (EW) blue-tailed skinks (*Cryptoblepharus egeriae*) and Lister's geckos (*Lepidodactylus listeri*) on Christmas Island. These endemic reptiles disappeared from the wild following the establishment of the invasive common wolf snake (*Lycodon capucinus*) on the island in the 1980s. In 2018--2019, 170 skinks and 160 geckos were released into a predator-free area after which they were monitored with robust design mark-recapture surveys for one year post-release.

Quantecol got involved with the analysis of the survey data, where we built a continuous time Jolly-Seber model to estimate per-capita recruitment, mortality rates of juvenile and adult skinks and geckos, and population sizes. Blue-tailed skinks flourished with high survival and recruitment rates leading to an increasing population size. Unfortuantely, Lister's geckos did not fare so well with a steadily decreasing population size and no evidence of recruitment.

The work was published today as an Open Access article in [*Animal Conservation*](https://doi.org/10.1111/acv.12940) and represents an important contribution to conservation science.
