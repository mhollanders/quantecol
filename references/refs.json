  {"id":"abadi2010","abstract":"Understanding population dynamics requires accurate estimates of demographic rates. Integrated population models combine demographic and survey data into a single, comprehensive analysis and provide more coherent estimates of vital rates. Integrated population models rely on the assumption that different data sets are independent, which is frequently violated in practice. Moreover, the precision that can be gained using integrated modeling compared to conventional modeling is only known from empirical studies. The present study used simulation methods to assess how the violation of the assumption of independence affects the statistical properties of the parameter estimators. Further, the gains in precision and accuracy from the model were explored under varying sample sizes. For capture–recapture, population survey, and reproductive success, we generated independent and dependent data that were analyzed with integrated and conventional models. We found only a minimal impact of the violation of the assumption of independence on the parameter estimates. Furthermore, we observed an overall gain in precision and accuracy when all three data sets were analyzed simultaneously. This was particularly pronounced when the sample size was small. These findings contribute to clearing the way for the application of integrated population models in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Abadi","given":"Fitsum"},{"family":"Gimenez","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Arlettaz","given":"Raphaël"},{"family":"Schaub","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"abadi2010","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/08-2235.1","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"7-14","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"An assessment of integrated population models: bias, accuracy, and violation of the assumption of independence","title-short":"An assessment of integrated population models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2235.1","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"acharya2016","abstract":"Researchers seeking to establish causal relationships frequently control for variables on the purported causal pathway, checking whether the original treatment effect then disappears. Unfortunately, this common approach may lead to biased estimates. In this article, we show that the bias can be avoided by focusing on a quantity of interest called the controlled direct effect. Under certain conditions, the controlled direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations—an important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation strategy from the biostatistics literature. We extend this approach by deriving a consistent variance estimator and demonstrating how to conduct a sensitivity analysis.

Sufﬁcient conditions for the robust uniform persistence of the total population, as well as of the susceptible and infected subpopulations, are given. The ﬁrst two forms of persistence depend entirely on the rate at which the population grows from the extinction state, respectively the rate at which the disease is vertically transmitted to offspring. We also discuss the competitive exclusion among the n infection strains, namely when a single infection strain survives and all the others go extinct. Numerical simulations are also presented, to account for the situations not covered by the analytical results.

Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused extensive amphibian declines globally and may hamper reintroduction attempts. To determine Bd dynamics in potential source populations for conservation translocations of the threatened California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) to Yosemite National Park, we conducted Bd sampling in two populations in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, U.S. A. At one of two sites, we observed lethally high Bd loads in early post-metamorphic life stages and confirmed one chytridiomycosis-induced mortality, the first such report for this species. These results informed source population site selection for subsequent R. draytonii conservation translocations.

  {"id":"alexander2022","abstract":"Habitat loss and fragmentation from conversion to agriculture are known threats to grassland species. However, continued agricultural intensification may further reduce a species distribution and realized niche. Here, we create species distribution models (SDMs) for the plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), an ecosystem engineer in grasslands, for historic and contemporary eras in a dynamic agroecosystem and test the “niche reduction hypothesis.” We compare SDMs created from gopher occurrences from the historic era ( 1950s, pre-agricultural intensification) and the contemporary era (post-agricultural intensification) and assess model transferability. We evaluate shifts in environmental relationships, changes in limiting factors, and an overall decline in niche hypervolume. SDMs were nontransferable between the historic and contemporary eras. Environmental drivers of gopher distribution shifted from elevation, precipitation, and land cover in the 1950s to land cover, soil texture, and soil drainage presently. There also were shifts in environmental associations with gophers now occurring at lower elevations, in sandier soils, and less often in agriculture. Dominant limiting factors of gophers shifted from precipitation to land cover. Gophers were not detected at historic locations during recent resurveys. Contemporary niche hypervolume was reduced compared with the historic niche hypervolume. We found support for the niche reduction hypothesis for a fossorial, grassland species. Further application of the niche reduction hypothesis in landscapes experiencing agricultural intensification is warranted. Understanding niche reduction allows for conservation efforts that promote continued persistence in the contemporary niche while also identifying areas to restore within the historic niche.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Cosentino","given":"Bradley J."},{"family":"Schooley","given":"Robert L."}],"citation-key":"alexander2022","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.9559","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"e9559","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Testing the niche reduction hypothesis for a fossorial rodent (Geomys bursarius) experiencing agricultural intensification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.9559","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"alford2007","abstract":"To gain information on the microhabitat use, home range and movement of a species, it is often necessary to remotely track individuals in the ﬁeld. Radio telemetry is commonly used to track amphibians, but can only be used on relatively large individuals. Harmonic direction ﬁnding can be used to track smaller animals, but its effectiveness has not been fully evaluated. Tag attachment can alter the behaviour of amphibians, suggesting that data obtained using either technique may be unreliable. We investigated the effects of external tag attachment on behaviour in the laboratory by observing 12 frogs for ﬁve nights before and ﬁve nights after tag attachment, allowing one night to recover from handling. Tag attachment did not affect distance moved or number of times moved, indicating that the effects of tag attachment are unlikely to persist after the ﬁrst night following attachment. We then compared harmonic direction ﬁnding and radio-telemetry using data collected in the ﬁeld. We ﬁtted rainforest stream frogs of three species with tags of either type, located them diurnally and nocturnally for approximately two weeks, and compared movement parameters between techniques. In the ﬁeld, we obtained fewer ﬁxes on frogs using harmonic direction ﬁnding, but measures of movement and habitat use did not differ signiﬁcantly between techniques. Because radio telemetry makes it possible to locate animals more consistently, it should be preferred for animals large enough to carry radio tags. If harmonic direction ﬁnding is necessary, it can produce reliable data, particularly for relatively sedentary species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Rowley","given":"Jodi J.

  {"id":"altman2019","abstract":"Given that climate change is predicted to alter patterns of temperature variability, it is important to understand how shifting temperatures might influence species interactions, including parasitism. Predicting thermal effects on species interactions is complicated, however, because the temperature-dependence of the interaction depends on the thermal responses of both interacting organisms, which can also be influenced by thermal acclimation, a process by which organisms adjust their physiologies in response to a temperature change. We tested for thermal acclimation effects on Lithobates clamitans tadpole susceptibility to the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) by acclimating tadpoles to 1 of 3 temperatures, moving them to 1 of 5 performance temperatures at which we exposed them to Bd, and measuring Bd loads on tadpoles postexposure. We predicted that (1) tadpole Bd load would peak at a lower temperature than the temperature for peak Bd growth in culture, and (2) tadpoles acclimated to intermediate temperatures would have overall lower Bd loads across performance temperatures than cold- or warm-acclimated tadpoles, similar to a previously published pattern describing tadpole resistance to trematode metacercariae. Consistent with our first prediction, Bd load on tadpoles decreased with increasing performance temperature. However, we found only weak support for our second prediction, as acclimation temperature had little effect on tadpole Bd load. Our results contribute to a growing body of work investigating thermal responses of hosts and parasites, which will aid in developing methods to predict the temperature-dependence of disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Altman","given":"K.

  {"id":"altwegg2003","abstract":"Strategies for optimal metamorphosis are key adaptations in organisms with complex life cycles, and the components of the larval growth environment causing variation in this trait are well studied empirically and theoretically. However, when relating these ﬁndings to a broader evolutionary or ecological context, usually the following assumptions are made: (1) size at metamorphosis positively relates to future ﬁtness, and (2) the larval growth environment affects ﬁtness mainly through its effect on timing of and size at metamorphosis. These assumptions remain poorly tested, because data on postmetamorphic ﬁtness components are still rare. We created variation in timing of and size at metamorphosis by manipulating larval competition, nonlethal presence of predators, pond drying, and onset of larval development, and measured the consequences for subsequent terrestrial survival and growth in 1564 individually marked water frogs (Rana lessonae and R. esculenta), raised in enclosures in their natural environment. Individuals metamorphosing at a large size had an increased chance of survival during the following terrestrial stage (mean linear selection gradient: 0.09), grew faster and were larger at maturity than individuals metamorphosing at smaller sizes. Late metamorphosing individuals had a lower survival rate (mean linear selection gradient: Ϫ0.03) and grew more slowly than early metamorphosing ones. We found these patterns to be consistent over the three years of the study and the two species, and the results did not depend on the nature of the larval growth manipulation. Furthermore, individuals did not compensate for a small size at metamorphosis by enhancing their postmetamorphic growth. Thus, we found simple relationships between larval growth and postmetamorphic ﬁtness components, and support for this frequently made assumption. Our results suggest postmetamorphic selection for fast larval growth and provide a quantitative estimate for the water frog example.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Altwegg","given":"Res"},{"family":"Reyer","given":"Heinz-Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"altwegg2003","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00298.x","ISSN":"0014-3820, 1558-5646","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4]]},"language":"en","page":"872-882","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Patterns of natural selection on size at metamorphosis in water frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00298.x","volume":"57"},

This allowed us to analyse call properties of males as a function of their infection status. Infected males called more rapidly and produced longer calls than uninfected males. This enhanced call effort may reflect pathogen manipulation of host behaviour to foster disease transmission. Alternatively, increased calling may have resulted from selection on infected males to reproduce earlier because of their shortened expected lifespan. Our results raise the possibility that sublethal effects of Bd alter amphibian life histories, which contributes to long-term population declines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"An","given":"Deuknam"},{"family":"Waldman","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"an2016","container-title":"Biology Letters","container-title-short":"Biol.

  {"id":"andersen2005","abstract":"Every year large proportions of northern Australia’s tropical savanna landscapes are burnt, resulting in high ﬁre frequencies and short intervals between ﬁres.The dominant ﬁre management paradigm in these regions is the use of low-intensity prescribed ﬁre early in the dry season, to reduce the incidence of higher-intensity, more extensive wildﬁre later in the year. This use of frequent prescribed ﬁre to mitigate against high-intensity wildﬁre has parallels with ﬁre management in temperate forests of southern Australia. However, unlike in southern Australia, the ecological implications of high ﬁre frequency have received little attention in the north. CSIRO and collaborators recently completed a landscape-scale ﬁre experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, and here we provide a synthesis of the effects of experimental ﬁre regimes on biodiversity, with particular consideration of ﬁre frequency and, more speciﬁcally, time-since-ﬁre. Two recurring themes emerged from Kapalga. First, much of the savanna biota is remarkably resilient to ﬁre, even of high intensity. Over the 5-year experimental period, the abundance of most invertebrate groups remained unaffected by ﬁre treatment, as did the abundance of most vertebrate species, and we were unable to detect any effect of ﬁre on ﬂoristic composition of the grass-layer. Riparian vegetation and associated stream biota, as well as small mammals, were notable exceptions to this general resilience. Second, the occurrence of ﬁre, independent of its intensity, was often the major factor inﬂuencing ﬁre-sensitive species. This was especially the case for extinction-prone small mammals, which have suffered serious population declines across northern Australia in recent decades. Results from Kapalga indicate that key components of the savanna biota of northern Australia favour habitat that has remained unburnt for at least several years. This raises a serious conservation concern, given that very little relatively long unburnt habitat currently occurs in conservation reserves, with most sites being burnt at least once every 2 years. We propose a conservation objective of increasing the area that remains relatively long unburnt.This could be achieved either by reducing the proportion of the landscape burnt each year, or by setting prescribed ﬁres more strategically. The provision of appropriately long unburnt habitat is a conservation challenge for Australia’s tropical savanna landscapes, just as it is for its temperate forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Alan N."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Garry D."},{"family":"Corbett","given":"Laurie K."},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Eager","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Russell-Smith","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Setterfield","given":"Samantha A."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Woinarski","given":"John C.

  {"id":"anderson2018","abstract":"As ectotherms, amphibians may exhibit changes in their thermal biology associated with spatial and temporal environmental contingencies. However, our knowledge on how amphibian´s thermal biology responds to seasonal changes in the environment is restricted to a few species, mostly from temperate regions, in a marked contrast with the high species diversity found in the Neotropics. We investigated whether or not the seasonal variation in climatic parameters from a high-montane ombrophilous forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could lead to concurrent adjustments in the thermal biology of the terrestrial toad Rhinella icterica. We measured active body temperature (Tb) in the ﬁeld, and preferred body temperature (Tpref) and thermal tolerance (critical thermal minimum, CTmin, and maximum, CTmax) in the laboratory, for toads collected at two distinct seasons: warm/wet and cold/dry. We also measured operative environmental temperatures (Te) using agar toad models coupled with dataloggers distributed in diﬀerent microhabitats in the ﬁeld to estimate accuracy (db) and effectiveness (E) of thermoregulation of the toads for both seasons. Toads had higher Tpref in the warm/wet season compared to the cold/dry season, even though no seasonal change occurred in ﬁeld Tb's. In the warm/wet season, toads decreased the accuracy of thermoregulation and avoided thermally favorable microhabitats, while in the cold/dry season they increased the accuracy of thermoregulation and exhibited high degree of thermoconformity. This result may encompass thermoregulatory adjustments to seasonal changes in Te's, but may also reﬂect seasonal diﬀerences in compromises between Tb regulation and other ecologically relevant activities (reproduction, foraging). Toads did not exhibit changes in CTmin or CTmax, which indicates a low risk of exposure to extreme temperatures in this particular habitat, at both seasons, possibly combined with a low ﬂexibility of this trait. Overall, our study shows seasonal acclimatization in some aspects of the thermal biology of the toad, R. icterica.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Rodolfo César de Oliveira"},{"family":"Bovo","given":"Rafael Parelli"},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Denis Vieira"}],"citation-key":"anderson2018","container-title":"Journal of Thermal Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.011","ISSN":"03064565","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"77-83","source":"Crossref","title":"Seasonal variation in the thermal biology of a terrestrial toad, <i>Rhinella icterica</i> (Bufonidae), from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306456517303364","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"andrew2021","abstract":"Questions The taxonomic and functional composition of plant communities captures different dimensions of diversity. Functional diversity (FD) — as calculated from species traits — typically increases with species richness in communities and is expected to be higher in less extreme environments, where a broader range of functional strategies can persist. Further, woody and herbaceous plant families may contribute disproportionately to FD in different bioregions. To build an understanding of these questions using Australia as a case study, we aimed to quantify how FD varies: (a) with species richness, (b) with climate, and (c) between major plant families representing different growth forms. Location Australia. Methods Data on species distribution and functional traits for 14,003 species were combined and FD approximated using hypervolumes (i.e. multidimensional species assemblage trait niche) based on three traits key to understanding plant ecological strategies: leaf size, seed mass and adult height. Plant assemblage hypervolumes were calculated including all species with suitable habitat in each 10 × 10 km grid cell across Australia, and in each of 85 bioregions. Within bioregions FD was also calculated separately for a suite of largely woody and herbaceous plant families. Relationships between FD, species richness and climate were explored. Results As predicted, FD was positively related to species richness and annual precipitation, and negatively related to summer maximum temperature, both in analyses of 10 km × 10 km grid cells and of bioregions (all p < 0.005). However, FD was lowest at intermediate winter minimum temperatures. Patterns identified in families representing different growth forms varied to those observed for all species analysed together. Conclusions Strong links between FD and climate could mean significant shifts in the FD of ecosystems with climate change. Monitoring changes in FD and associated ecosystem functions requires a detailed understanding of FD, which we begin to develop in this study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrew","given":"Samuel C."},{"family":"Mokany","given":"Karel"},{"family":"Falster","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Wenk","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Ian J."},{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Rachael V."}],"citation-key":"andrew2021","container-title":"Journal of Vegetation Science","DOI":"10.1111/jvs.13018","ISSN":"1654-1103","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e13018","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Functional diversity of the Australian flora: Strong links to species richness and climate","title-short":"Functional diversity of the Australian flora","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jvs.13018","volume":"32"},

We used a beyond-BACI (Before, After, Control, Impact) design to investigate the effects of a prescribed ﬁre on a stream ecosystem and compared these ﬁndings to similar data collected after wildﬁre. For 3 years after prescribed ﬁre treatment, we found no detectable changes in periphyton, macroinvertebrates, amphibians, ﬁsh, and riparian and stream habitats compared to data collected over the same time period in four unburned reference streams. Based on changes in fuels, plant and litter cover, and tree scorching, this prescribed ﬁre was typical of those being implemented in ponderosa pine forests throughout the western U.S. However, we found that the extent and severity of riparian vegetation burned was substantially lower after prescribed ﬁre compared to nearby wildﬁres. The early-season prescribed ﬁre did not mimic the riparian or in-stream ecological effects observed following a nearby wildﬁre, even in catchments with burn extents similar to the prescribed ﬁre. Little information exists on the effects of long-term ﬁre exclusion from riparian forests, but a ‘‘prescribed ﬁre regime’’ of repeatedly burning upland forests while excluding ﬁre in adjacent riparian forests may eliminate an important natural disturbance from riparian and stream habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Arkle","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Pilliod","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"arkle2010","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2009.11.029","ISSN":"03781127","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"language":"en","page":"893-903","source":"Crossref","title":"Prescribed fires as ecological surrogates for wildfires: A stream and riparian perspective","title-short":"Prescribed fires as ecological surrogates for wildfires","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112709008603","volume":"259"},
  {"id":"armstrong2013","abstract":"Dispersal from release areas is a critical problem for reintroductions. Reliable methods are therefore needed for analysing post-release monitoring data to guide further releases. Radio tracking can greatly improve data quality by distinguishing dispersal from mortality. However, fates of animals continue to be uncertain if transmitters have short battery life and detection range, as is typically the case with small animals. We present an approach for simultaneously modelling probabilities of ﬁdelity (remaining in release area), survival, detection and transmitter failure from post-release monitoring data, and illustrate how it was applied to translocations of North Island robins (Petroica longipes) to 17 forest fragments (5–56 ha) over 5 years. The modelling showed that ﬁdelity probability depended on the sex (higher in females) and translocation date (higher in winter than autumn), and that variation among fragments was well explained by the ‘‘cost distance to nearest neighbour’’ (an index reﬂecting the amount of pasture and shrubland needing to be crossed to reach another forest area) and the area of the release fragment (higher in larger fragments). Combined with survival, the estimated probability of a bird remaining in its release fragment the next breeding season ranged from 0.02 to 0.39. As these estimates were reﬁned, they could be used to assess suitability of fragments for further releases and numbers of each sex needing to be released to compensate for dispersal. The Bayesian framework underlying the approach potentially allows application to any amount of data by using informative priors derived from previous translocations or expert opinion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Doug P."},{"family":"McArthur","given":"Nikki"},{"family":"Govella","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Gorman","given":"Nic"},{"family":"Pike","given":"Rhonda"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Yvan"}],"citation-key":"armstrong2013","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2013.09.028","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"language":"en","page":"152-160","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using radio-tracking data to predict post-release establishment in reintroductions to habitat fragments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320713003455","volume":"168"},

To assist in the conservation of these taxa, we evaluated how communities and populations of amphibians and reptiles varied with fire history in rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides) scrub. We calculated species richness, evenness, total abundance, and individual species abundance for all amphibians and reptiles captured from May through August 2003 and May 2004 at 12 rosemary scrub sites in Highlands County, Florida, that differed in fire history (time since last fire, TSF). Vegetation structure (bare ground and canopy cover) varied polynomially with TSF, with intermediate TSF sites most open and long-unburned sites least open. Species richness, evenness, and total abundance did not vary with fire history. At the species level, only two species, Plestiodon reynoldsi and Aspidoscelis sexlineata, showed significant relationships with TSF: P. reynoldsi was most common in least open, longest-unburned areas and least common in most open, intermediately burned areas, whereas A. sexlineata was most common in most open and intermediately burned areas and least common in recently and long-unburned areas. The close relationship of abundance to vegetation structure suggests that indirect fire-induced changes may be more important than fire per se.

  {"id":"augustine2019","abstract":"Recently introduced unmarked spatial capture–recapture (SCR), spatial mark–resight (SMR), and 2-ﬂank spatial partial identity models (SPIMs) extend the domain of SCR to populations or observation systems that do not always allow for individual identity to be determined with certainty. For example, some species do not have natural marks that can reliably produce individual identities from photographs, and some methods of observation produce partial identity samples as is the case with remote cameras that sometimes produce single-ﬂank photographs. Unmarked SCR, SMR, and SPIM share the feature that they probabilistically resolve the uncertainty in individual identity using the spatial location where samples were collected. Spatial location is informative of individual identity in spatially structured populations because a sample is more likely to have been produced by an individual living near the trap where it was recorded than an individual living further away from the trap. Further, the level of information about individual identity that a spatial location contains is related to two key ecological concepts, population density and home range size, which we quantify using a proposed Identity Diversity Index (IDI). We show that latent and partial identity SCR models produce imprecise and biased density estimates in many high IDI scenarios when data are sparse. We then extend the unmarked SCR model to incorporate categorical, partially identifying covariates, which reduce the level of uncertainty in individual identity, increasing the reliability and precision of density estimates, and allowing reliable density estimation in scenarios with higher IDI values and with more sparse data. We illustrate the performance of this “categorical SPIM” via simulations and by applying it to a black bear data set using microsatellite loci as categorical covariates, where we reproduce the full data set estimates with only slightly less precision using fewer loci than necessary for conﬁdent individual identiﬁcation. We then discuss how the categorical SPIM can be applied to other wildlife sampling scenarios such as remote camera surveys, where natural or researcher-applied partial marks can be observed in photographs. Finally, we discuss how the categorical SPIM can be added to SMR, 2-ﬂank SPIM, or other latent identity SCR models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Augustine","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

It has a protected status in Papua New Guinea but not in Indonesian Papua and several US and European zoos have active captive breeding programs that have been largely unsuccessful. To understand the degree of genetic diversity in wild and captive animals we undertook a genetic analysis of 90 M. boeleni for which we sequenced two mtDNA loci and one nuclear locus for a total of 1,418 bp of sequence data per individual. All 16 wild-caught M. boeleni from Indonesia and all captive M. boeleni are genetically uniform for all three loci. The single wild-caught animal from Papua New Guinea showed extremely low levels of genetic divergence and diversity from the Indonesian and captive samples. Data from two congeners, M. amethistina and M. viridis, suggests that M. boeleni have reduced genetic variation with a small effective population size possibly due to historical bottlenecks. These data demonstrate the need for further studies of genetic diversity of M. boeleni from across its range and raise particular concern for the limited genetic diversity of M. boeleni used captive breeding programs in zoological parks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Christopher C."},{"family":"Spataro","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Stacy"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"McVay","given":"John D."}],"citation-key":"austin2010","container-title":"Conservation Genetics","DOI":"10.1007/s10592-009-9931-z","ISSN":"1566-0621, 1572-9737","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"language":"en","page":"889-896","source":"Crossref","title":"Conservation genetics of Boelen’s python (<i>Morelia boeleni</i>) from New Guinea: reduced genetic diversity and divergence of captive and wild animals","title-short":"Conservation genetics of Boelen’s python (Morelia boeleni) from New Guinea","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10592-009-9931-z","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"barros2023","abstract":"One of the aims of island biogeography theory is to explain the number of species in an archipelago. Traditionally, the variables used to explain the species richness on an island are its area and distance to the mainland. However, increasing evidence suggests that accounting for other variables is essential for better estimates. In particular, the distance between islands should play a role in determining species richness. This work uses a Bayesian framework using Gaussian processes to assess whether distance to neighbouring islands (spatial autocorrelation) can better explain arthropod species richness patterns in the Azores Archipelago and in the Canary Islands. This method is flexible and allows the inclusion of other variables, such as maximum altitude above sea level (elevation). The results show that accounting for spatial autocorrelation provides the best results for both archipelagos, but overall, spatial autocorrelation seems to be more important in the Canary archipelago. Similarly, elevation plays a more important role in determining species richness in the Canary Islands. We recommend that spatial autocorrelation should always be considered when modelling an archipelago’s species richness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Barros","given":"Diogo Duarte"},{"family":"Mathias","given":"Maria da Luz"},{"family":"Borges","given":"Paulo A.

  {"id":"bataille2015","abstract":"The pathogenic chytrid fungus\n              Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\n              (Bd) can cause precipitous population declines in its amphibian hosts. Responses of individuals to infection vary greatly with the capacity of their immune system to respond to the pathogen. We used a combination of comparative and experimental approaches to identify major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) alleles encoding molecules that foster the survival of Bd-infected amphibians. We found that Bd-resistant amphibians across four continents share common amino acids in three binding pockets of the MHC-II antigen-binding groove. Moreover, strong signals of selection acting on these specific sites were evident among all species co-existing with the pathogen. In the laboratory, we experimentally inoculated Australian tree frogs with Bd to test how each binding pocket conformation influences disease resistance. Only the conformation of MHC-II pocket 9 of surviving subjects matched those of Bd-resistant species. This MHC-II conformation thus may determine amphibian resistance to Bd, although other MHC-II binding pockets also may contribute to resistance. Rescuing amphibian biodiversity will depend on our understanding of amphibian immune defence mechanisms against Bd. The identification of adaptive genetic markers for Bd resistance represents an important step forward towards that goal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bataille","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David"},{"family":"McFadden","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Scheele","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Brannelly","given":"Laura A."},{"family":"Macris","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Harlow","given":"Peter S."},{"family":"Bell","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Waldman","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"bataille2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"bell2020","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis has been a key driver of global frog declines and extinctions, particularly for high-altitude populations across Australia and the Americas. While recent evidence shows some species are recovering, the extent of such recoveries and the mechanisms underpinning them remain poorly resolved. We surveyed the historical latitudinal and elevational range of four Australian rainforest frogs that disappeared from upland sites between 1989 and 1994 to establish their contemporary distribution and elevational limits, and investigate factors affecting population recovery. Five rainforest streams were surveyed from mountain-base to summit (30 sites in total), with swabs collected from the target species (Litoria dayi, L. nannotis, L. rheocola, and L. serrata) to determine their infection status, and data loggers deployed to measure microclimatic variation across the elevational gradient. Infection probability increased with elevation and canopy cover as it was tightly and inversely correlated with stream-side air temperature. Occupancy patterns suggest varying responses to this disease threat gradient. Two species, L. rheocola and L. serrata, were found over their full historical elevational range (≥1,000 m above sea level [asl]), while L. dayi was not detected above 400 m (formerly known up to 900 m asl) and L. nannotis was not detected above 800 m (formerly known up to 1,200 m asl). Site occupancy probability was negatively related to predicted infection prevalence for L. dayi, L. nannotis, and L. rheocola, but not L. serrata, which appears to now tolerate high fungal burdens. This study highlights the importance of environmental refuges and connectivity across disease risk gradients for the persistence and natural recovery of frogs susceptible to chytridiomycosis. Likewise, in documenting both interspecific variation in recovery rates and intraspecific differences between sites, this study suggests interactions between disease threats and host selection exist that could be manipulated. For example, translocations may be warranted where connectivity is poor or the increase in disease risk is too steep to allow recolonization, combined with assisted selection or use of founders from populations that have already undergone natural selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Sara C."},{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey W."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."}],"citation-key":"bell2020","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1002/eap.2152","ISSN":"1051-0761, 1939-5582","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10]]},"language":"en","page":"e02152","source":"Crossref","title":"Connectivity over a disease risk gradient enables recovery of rainforest frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2152","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"bendik2013","abstract":"Despite recognition that nearly one-third of the 6300 amphibian species are threatened with extinction, our understanding of the general ecology and population status of many amphibians is relatively poor. A widely-used method for monitoring amphibians involves injecting captured individuals with unique combinations of colored visible implant elastomer (VIE). We compared VIE identification to a less-invasive method – computer-assisted photographic identification (photoID) – in endangered Jollyville Plateau salamanders (Eurycea tonkawae), a species with a known range limited to eight stream drainages in central Texas. We based photoID on the unique pigmentation patterns on the dorsal head region of 1215 individual salamanders using identification software Wild-ID. We compared the performance of photoID methods to VIEs using both ‘high-quality’ and ‘low-quality’ images, which were taken using two different camera types and technologies. For high-quality images, the photoID method had a false rejection rate of 0.76% compared to 1.90% for VIEs. Using a comparable dataset of lower-quality images, the false rejection rate was much higher (15.9%). Photo matching scores were negatively correlated with time between captures, suggesting that evolving natural marks could increase misidentification rates in longer term capture-recapture studies. Our study demonstrates the utility of large-scale capture-recapture using photo identification methods for Eurycea and other species with stable natural marks that can be reliably photographed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bendik","given":"Nathan F."},{"family":"Morrison","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Gluesenkamp","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Sanders","given":"Mark S."},{"family":"O’Donnell","given":"Lisa J."}],"citation-key":"bendik2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0059424","editor":[{"family":"Hemmi","given":"Jan M."}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e59424","source":"Crossref","title":"Computer-assisted photo identification outperforms visible implant elastomers in an endangered salamander, <i>Eurycea tonkawae</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059424","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"beranek","abstract":"Aim Changes to the extent and severity of wildfires driven by anthropogenic climate change are predicted to have compounding negative consequences for ecological communities. While there is evidence that severe weather events like drought impact amphibian communities, the effects of wildfire on such communities are not well understood. The impact of wildfire on amphibian communities and species is likely to vary, owing to the diversity of their life-history traits. However, no previous research has identified commonalities among the amphibians at most risk from wildfire, limiting conservation initiatives in the aftermath of severe wildfire. We aimed to investigate the impacts of the unprecedented 2019–2020 black summer bushfires on Australian forest amphibian communities. Location Eastern coast of New South Wales, Australia. Methods We conducted visual encounter surveys and passive acoustic monitoring across 411 sites within two regions, one in northeast and one in southeast New South Wales. We used fire severity and extent mapping in two multispecies occupancy models to assess the impacts of fire on 35 forest amphibian species. Results We demonstrate a negative influence of severe fire extent on metacommunity occupancy and species richness in the south with weaker effects in the north—reflective of the less severe fires that occurred in this region. Both threatened and common species were impacted by severe wildfire extent. Occupancy of burrowing species and rain forest specialists had mostly negative relationships with severe wildfire extent, while arboreal amphibians had neutral relationships. Main Conclusion Metacommunity monitoring and adaptive conservation strategies are needed to account for common species after severe climatic events. Ecological, morphological and life-history variation drives the susceptibility of amphibians to wildfires. We document the first evidence of climate change-driven wildfires impacting temperate forest amphibian communities across a broad geographic area, which raises serious concern for the persistence of amphibians under an increasingly fire-prone climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Beranek","given":"Chad T."},{"family":"Hamer","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Stephen V."},{"family":"Stauber","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Shelby A."},{"family":"Gould","given":"John"},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Stock","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Parkin","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Weigner","given":"Rudolf"},{"family":"Daly","given":"Garry"},{"family":"Callen","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Rowley","given":"Jodi J.

  {"id":"beranek2022","abstract":"Understanding amphibian population dynamics is integral to mitigating severe declines that are occurring due to threats such as habitat removal and chytrid-induced disease. Few studies have focused on sexspeciﬁc population dynamics, despite the potential for these processes to alter colonisation and population turnover in newly created habitats. Here, we investigate sex-speciﬁc population dynamics in the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) using intensive capture-recapture methods in a newly created wetland complex and control sites. As hypothesised, females took longer to reach maturity compared to males. The length of female maturation was 3.9 times greater than that of males (428.68 days Æ 107.6 SD and 110.16 days Æ 20.59 SD, respectively). This resulted in a one-year delay in female population size increase compared to the male population. The operational sex ratio (OSR) in the second year of monitoring in the created wetlands had the most disproportionate male bias out of any year and any site (12/1 male/female, male proportion = 0.92 Æ 0.89–0.94 95% CI). In the third year, the OSR had become less male biased (2.6/1, male proportion = 0.72 Æ 65–0.78 95% CI), likely attributed to the maturing of the females produced in the ﬁrst year breeding events. We did not ﬁnd any evidence that survival or detection probability inﬂuenced the observed OSRs in the created wetlands. Based on survival rates of each sex, we estimate that males are 77 times more likely to reach sexual maturity compared to females. We postulate that the combination of chytrid-induced disease and sex-biased maturation rates may be a driver of declines, especially in populations with limited recruitment. We encourage future research into investigating sex-speciﬁc population dynamics of amphibians, especially relating to reintroduction ecology and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Beranek","given":"Chad T."},{"family":"Maynard","given":"Cassandra"},{"family":"McHenry","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Clulow","given":"John"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"beranek2022","container-title":"Austral Ecology","container-title-short":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/aec.13098","ISSN":"1442-9985, 1442-9993","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4]]},"language":"en","page":"239-250","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Identifying a limiting factor in the population dynamics of a threatened amphibian: The influence of extended female maturation on operational sex ratio","title-short":"Identifying a limiting factor in the population dynamics of a threatened amphibian","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aec.13098","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"berg2010","abstract":"Telemetry studies of newt species demand small transmitters. Two types of external attachments (sutured to epidermis and backpack) and traditional implanting in the peritoneal cavity were tested between groups of 5 adult individuals of the crested newt Triturus cristatus (mass 6-15 g) held in terrariums under controlled environmental conditions. The newts were anaesthetized with 1.5 g l−1 MS222, delivered in water and buffered to pH 6.9 by Na2CO2. Surgical plane of anaesthesia was achieved after 5-12 minutes and lasted for 30-60 minutes. External tagging proved unsuitable because transmitters became entangled in vegetation, and all animals shed their transmitters shortly after tagging, except for one that died. Transmitters that were surgically implanted in the peritoneal cavity were more successful. By the fourth day following surgery, the animals that had undergone surgery behaved similarly to control animals with respect to the use of cover. Two of the newts died, however, without showing any signs of illness in advance, and the cause of death could not be established. Based on the present experiments and published studies, implantable transmitters appear to be the best method for radiotagging small and medium sized urodele species such as T. cristatus, to gain crucial information on spatio-temporal terrestrial activity patterns, habitat utilization and hibernation sites.

Design A pathological survey and a transmission experiment were conducted. Procedure Diagnostic pathology examinations were performed on free-living and captive, ill and dead amphibians collected opportunistically from eastern Australia between October 1993 and December 2000. We conducted a transmission experiment in the laboratory to investigate the effects of temperature: eight great barred frogs (Mixophyes fasciolatus) exposed to zoospores of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and six unexposed frogs were housed individually in each of three rooms held at 17°C, 23°C and 27°C.\nResults Chytridiomycosis was the cause of death or morbidity for 133 (55.2%) of 241 free-living amphibians and for 66 (58.4%) of 113 captive amphibians. This disease occurred in 34 amphibian species, was widespread around the eastern seaboard of Australia and affected amphibians in a variety of habitats at high and low altitudes on or between the Great Dividing Range and the coast. The incidence of chytridiomycosis was higher in winter, with 53% of wild frogs from Queensland and New South Wales dying in July and August. Other diseases were much less common and were detected mostly in spring and summer. In experimental infections, lower temperatures enhanced the pathogenicity of B dendrobatidis in M fasciolatus. All 16 frogs exposed to B dendrobatidis at 17°C and 23°C died, whereas 4 of 8 frogs exposed at 27°C survived. However, the time until death for the frogs that died at 27°C was shorter than at the lower temperatures. Infections in survivors were eliminated by 98 days.\nConclusion Chytridiomycosis is a major cause of mortality in free-living and captive amphibians in Australia and mortality rate increases at lower temperatures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Speare","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Hines","given":"Harry B."},{"family":"Marantelli","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"Hyatt","given":"Alex D."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Olsen","given":"V."},{"family":"Clarke","given":"J.

Large numbers of sporangia occurred in all areas of ventral skin and toes; on average there were 94.3 sporangia mm–1 of superficial epidermis. The number of sporangia was highly variable and this appeared to be related to the stage in the cycle of sloughing. The stratum corneum tends to build up with high intensities of infection and then sheds entirely rather than being shed continuously. Very few or no sporangia occurred on dorsal skin. This distribution could be explained by the dryness of the dorsal skin or possibly by the greater number of serous glands, which produce antifungal peptides, on the dorsum.

Although chytridiomycosis is an emerging disease, B. dendrobatidis has adaptations that suggest it has long been evolved to live within cells in the dynamic tissue of the stratified epidermis. Sporangia developed at a rate that coincided with the maturation of the cell, and fungal discharge tubes usually opened onto the distal surface of epidermal cells of the stratum corneum. A zone of condensed, fibrillar, host cytoplasm surrounded some sporangia. Hyperkeratosis may be due to (1) a hyperplastic response that leads to an increased turnover of epidermal cells, and (2) premature keratinization and death of infected cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Hyatt","given":"Alex D."},{"family":"Speare","given":"R."},{"family":"Longcore","given":"Joyce E."}],"citation-key":"berger2005b","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao068051","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"51-63","source":"Crossref","title":"Life cycle stages of the amphibian chytrid <i><span class=\"nocase\">Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</span></i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v68/n1/p51-63/","volume":"68"},

For treatment trials of juvenile Litoria caerulea, baths of benzalkonium chloride at 1 mg/L and ﬂuconazole at 25 mg/L were used on 18 experimentally infected frogs per treatment. Although these treatments resulted in longer survival times (mean 43.7 ± 11.3 days) than in the untreated controls (37.9 ± 9.3 days), the mortality rate was still 100%. Higher doses of ﬂuconazole are suggested for further animal trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger","given":"L."},{"family":"Speare","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Marantelli","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."}],"citation-key":"berger2009","container-title":"Research in Veterinary Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.11.005","ISSN":"00345288","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8]]},"language":"en","page":"106-110","source":"Crossref","title":"A zoospore inhibition technique to evaluate the activity of antifungal compounds against <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> and unsuccessful treatment of experimentally infected green tree frogs (<i>Litoria caerulea</i>) by fluconazole and benzalkonium chloride","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034528808002427","volume":"87"},
  {"id":"berger2010","abstract":"Effective and safe treatments of amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), are needed to prevent mortality in captive programs, reduce the risk of disease spread, and better manage the disease in threatened wild populations. Bd is susceptible to a range of antifungal agents and low levels of heat (> 30°C) when tested in vitro, but there are few proven methods for clearing adult amphibians of Bd, and acute drug toxicity is a problem for tadpoles and juveniles. In postmetamorphic animals, heat (32 and 37°C) is the only well-supported treatment. Antifungal drugs have not undergone rigorous testing — for example, trials were small or lacked controls and thorough post-treatment testing. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed so there are no data on blood or tissue levels of antifungal agents. However, itraconazole baths have been widely used in amphibian rescue and conservation programs and anecdotal evidence suggests that they are effective for adults and subadults. In an experimental trial with tadpoles, a low dose of itraconazole cleared Bd but may have been associated with cutaneous depigmentation. Fluconazole appeared safe for tadpoles as it did not cause mortality, and future attempts to find an effective dose may be worthwhile. Palliative restoration of blood sodium and potassium levels by administration of electrolyte solutions appears useful in frogs with clinical chytridiomycosis. Randomised and blinded clinical trials, which include basic pharmacological studies, are urgently needed to provide comparable evidence for the safety and efficacy of treatment options which are likely to vary with amphibian species. Priorities are to validate and optimize the use of heat and itraconazole regimes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger","given":"L."},{"family":"Speare","given":"R."},{"family":"Pessier","given":"A."},{"family":"Voyles","given":"J."},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"L.

  {"id":"bertolero2007","abstract":"Although reintroduction programmes are often implemented for recovering animal populations, projects seldom monitor the long-term survival of released animals. In addition, although many releases may occur in the same area, little is known about how the survival of successive release batches is affected by the presence of conspeciﬁcs and density dependence. Here, we use multi-state capture–recapture modelling (combining information from recaptures and recoveries) to analyse the survival of two batches of Hermann’s tortoise Testudo hermanni hermanni released in a 10-year interval and monitored for 18 years at the Ebro Delta (western Mediterranean). We also tested whether the released animals experienced lower survival (i.e. a release cost) before becoming familiar with the new environment. Although we used a hard-release method, neither group experienced a short-term release cost. Annual survival of both groups differed and was not negatively affected by density-dependent factors. Annual survivorship of the ﬁrst group of released tortoises was constant and very high (0.945, SE = 0.011), and similar to that estimated from several natural populations. The presence of a terrestrial predator in 1 year (before the release of the second group) signiﬁcantly decreased the survival of tortoises (0.819, SE = 0.073). Strikingly, survival of the second batch was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the ﬁrst group after the ﬁrst years of release (0.775, SE = 0.049). Although survivorship for the ﬁrst group suggested that habitat quality was high, the second group seemed not to acclimate well to the new environment, possibly due to the presence of resident tortoises. From a management perspective, reintroduction programmes of the Hermann’s tortoise are a successful strategy for its recovery. Nevertheless, it seems advisable to avoid: (1) the release of tortoises at the core of well-established populations and (2) areas with a high density of predators, which can jeopardize the reintroduction success, especially when the number of released individuals is small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bertolero","given":"A."},{"family":"Oro","given":"D."},{"family":"Besnard","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"bertolero2007","container-title":"Animal Conservation","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00121.x","ISSN":"1367-9430, 1469-1795","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8]]},"language":"en","page":"360-368","source":"Crossref","title":"Assessing the efficacy of reintroduction programmes by modelling adult survival: the example of Hermann's tortoise","title-short":"Assessing the efficacy of reintroduction programmes by modelling adult survival","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00121.x","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"besbeas2014","abstract":"Integrated population modelling is proving to be an important and useful technique in statistical ecology. However, there is currently no simple formal method for judging how well models fit data, when potentially several different data sets described by different structured models are being analysed in combination. We propose and evaluate a new approach, of calibrated simulation. Here, comparative data sets are obtained from simulating data when model parameter values are obtained from the assumed asymptotic normal distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimators from the real data. The approach is motivated and justified by Bayesian P-values. Calibration of the resulting statistics is achieved as repeated data sets are easily simulated from the fitted model. The method requires the specification of model discrepancy measures, and we show how different measures can highlight different aspects of fit. Calibration is only strictly necessary if the statistics proposed may appear to be extreme. The approach of using calibrated simulation to check the goodness-of-fit of integrated population models is demonstrated by application to data sets on lapwings and herons. In each case, there are two data sets involved in the integrated analysis, and for each component data set, discrepancy measures of goodness-of-fit are obtained. For the lapwing application, as replication is efficient, it is possible to calibrate the procedure simply by using additional simulations. The heron application is shown to be feasible, but is substantially harder to calibrate, due to the presence of productivity thresholds that need to be estimated using profile likelihood methods. We demonstrate the importance of taking more than one discrepancy measure for time-series data. Avenues for future research are outlined.

Laboratory trials reveal that innate variation in thermal preference, rather than behavioural fever, can inhibit infection and facilitate salamander recovery under humidity-saturated conditions. Yet, a 3-year ﬁeld study and a mesocosm experiment close to the invasive Bsal range show that microclimate constraints suppress host thermal behaviour favourable to disease control. A ﬁnal mechanistic model, that estimates range-wide, year-round host body temperature relative to microclimate, suggests that these constraints are rule rather than exception.

  {"id":"beukema2021","abstract":"Starting in 2010, rapid fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) population declines in northwestern Europe heralded the emergence of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), a salamander-pathogenic chytrid fungus. Bsal poses an imminent threat to global salamander diversity owing to its wide host range, high pathogenicity, and long-term persistence in ecosystems. While there is a pressing need to develop further research and conservation actions, data limitations inherent to recent pathogen emergence obscure necessary insights into Bsal disease ecology. Here, we use a hierarchical modeling framework to describe Bsal landscape epidemiology of outbreak sites in light of these methodological challenges. Using model selection and machine learning, we find that Bsal presence is associated with humid and relatively cool, stable climates. Outbreaks are generally located in areas characterized by low landscape heterogeneity and low steepness of slope. We further find an association between Bsal presence and high trail density, suggesting that human-mediated spread may increase risk for spillover between populations. We then use distribution modeling to show that favorable conditions occur in lowlands influenced by the North Sea, where increased survey effort is needed to determine how Bsal impacts local newt populations, but also in hill- and mountain ranges in northeastern France and the lower half of Germany. Finally, connectivity analyses suggest that these hill- and mountain ranges may act as stepping stones for further spread southward. Our results provide initial insight into regional environmental conditions underlying Bsal epizootics, present updated invasibility predictions for northwestern Europe, and lead us to discuss a wide variety of potential survey and research actions needed to advance future conservation and mitigation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Beukema","given":"Wouter"},{"family":"Erens","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Schulz","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Stegen","given":"Gwij"},{"family":"Spitzen‐van der Sluijs","given":"Annemarieke"},{"family":"Stark","given":"Tariq"},{"family":"Laudelout","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Kinet","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Kirschey","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Poulain","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Miaud","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Steinfartz","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Martel","given":"An"},{"family":"Pasmans","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"beukema2021","container-title":"Ecological Applications","container-title-short":"Ecol Appl","DOI":"10.1002/eap.2342","ISSN":"1051-0761, 1939-5582","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Landscape epidemiology of <i>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</i>: reconciling data limitations and conservation urgency","title-short":"Landscape epidemiology of <i>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2342","volume":"31"},

We use our ﬁndings to identify those species most at risk of Bd-related declines and global extinction in the future, and identify areas where many species are predicted to be susceptible.

More than half of the literature (56%) investigated postmetamorphic stages, whereas premetamorphic stages were considered in 23% of the reviewed studies, and only 13% included both life stages.

However, other host characteristics such as growth/development, behavior, and specific mucosome/microbiome were considered in only one of four studies. Most research included at least one biotic factor (e.g., host and pathogen identity, species diversity, genetic adaptations), but only one-third considered environmental factors (e.g., temperature, landscape features, inorganic chemicals). Furthermore, there is no general consensus about the factors driving epidemiological patterns of pathogens in amphibian communities, and it is clear that the complexity and specificity of interactions between ecological factors and host–pathogen dynamics make conservation implications difficult and management decisions challenging.

However, it remains unclear whether populations actually are inﬂuenced by such “demographic buffering,” because variation in vital rates can be compared on different measurement scales, and there has been little attempt to investigate whether the choice of scale inﬂuences the chance of detecting demographic buffering. We compared two statistical approaches to examine whether demographic buffering has inﬂuenced vital rates in wild Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus). To account for statistical variance constraints on vital rates limited between 0 and 1 in analyses of demographic buffering, one approach is to scale observed variation by the maximum possible variation on the arithmetic scale. When applying this approach, the results suggested that demographic buffering was occurring. However, when we applied an alternative approach that identiﬁed statistical variance constraints on the logit scale, there was no evidence for demographic buffering. Thus, the choice of measurement scale must be carefully considered before one can fully understand whether demographic buffering inﬂuences life histories.

  {"id":"blaustein2005","abstract":"Abstract: As part of an overall biodiversity crisis many amphibian populations are in decline throughout the world. Numerous causes have been invoked to explain these declines. These include habitat destruction, climate change, increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation, environmental contamination, and the introduction of non-native species and diseases. Several types of pathogens have been implicated in contributing to amphibian population declines: viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. One particular fungus, the chytridiomycete Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis may have caused amphibian population declines in several regions. This pathogen causes chytridiomycosis, which is fatal to newly metamorphic and adult amphibians of certain species. We present experimental evidence that larval stages may also be susceptible to exposure to Batrachochytrium. There was, however, differential sensitivity to B. dendrobatidis in larvae we examined. In laboratory experiments, larval western toads ( Bufo boreas) exposed to B. dendrobatidis experienced increased mortality and behaviors that suggested they were affected by exposure compared with unexposed control tadpoles. Larvae of Cascades frogs ( Rana cascadae), bullfrogs (R. catesbeiana), and Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla) did not die after exposure to Batrachochytrium and appeared to behave normally. R. cascadae larvae exposed to B. dendrobatidis, however, showed an increase incidence in mouthpart abnormalities, a characteristic effect of chytridiomycosis, compared with unexposed controls. These results show that Batrachochytrium can negatively affect some species of amphibians at the larval stage and not others. The implications of interspecific variation in susceptibility to fungal infection are broad.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Romansic","given":"John M."},{"family":"Scheessele","given":"Erin A."},{"family":"Han","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Pessier","given":"Allan P."},{"family":"Longcore","given":"Joyce E."}],"citation-key":"blaustein2005","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00195.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"1460-1468","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Interspecific variation in susceptibility of frog tadpoles to the pathogenic fungus <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00195.x","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"blaustein2018","abstract":"Numerous factors are contributing to the loss of biodiversity. These include complex effects of multiple abiotic and biotic stressors that may drive population losses. These losses are especially illustrated by amphibians, whose populations are declining worldwide. The causes of amphibian population declines are multifaceted and context-dependent. One major factor affecting amphibian populations is emerging infectious disease. Several pathogens and their associated diseases are especially signiﬁcant contributors to amphibian population declines. These include the fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans, and ranaviruses. In this review, we assess the effects of these three pathogens on amphibian hosts as found through experimental studies. Such studies offer valuable insights to the causal factors underpinning broad patterns reported through observational studies. We summarize key ﬁndings from experimental studies in the laboratory, in mesocosms, and from the ﬁeld. We also summarize experiments that explore the interactive effects of these pathogens with other contributors of amphibian population declines. Though well-designed experimental studies are critical for understanding the impacts of disease, inconsistencies in experimental methodologies limit our ability to form comparisons and conclusions. Studies of the three pathogens we focus on show that host susceptibility varies with such factors as species, host age, life history stage, population and biotic (e.g., presence of competitors, predators) and abiotic conditions (e.g., temperature, presence of contaminants), as well as the strain and dose of the pathogen, to which hosts are exposed. Our ﬁndings suggest the importance of implementing standard protocols and reporting for experimental studies of amphibian disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Urbina","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Dang","given":"Trang"},{"family":"Hoverman","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Han","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Deanna"},{"family":"Searle","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Hambalek","given":"Natalie"}],"citation-key":"blaustein2018","container-title":"Diversity","DOI":"10.3390/d10030081","ISSN":"1424-2818","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,4]]},"language":"en","page":"81","source":"Crossref","title":"Effects of emerging infectious diseases on amphibians: a review of experimental studies","title-short":"Effects of Emerging Infectious Diseases on Amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/10/3/81","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"blaustein2020","abstract":"The mechanisms by which invasive species negatively affect native species include competition, predation, and the introduction of novel pathogens. Moreover, if an invasive species is a competent disease reservoir, it may facilitate the long-term maintenance and spread of pathogens in ecological assemblages and drive the extinction of less tolerant or less resistant species. Disease-driven loss of biodiversity is exemplified by the amphibian–chytrid fungus system. The disease chytridiomycosis is caused by the aquatic chytrid fungus\n              Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\n              (Bd) in anurans and is associated with worldwide amphibian population declines and extinctions. For amphibian species that metamorphose and leave infected aquatic habitats, the mechanisms by which Bd persists over winter in these habitats remains a critical open question. A leading hypothesis is that American bullfrogs (\n              Rana catesbeiana\n              ), a worldwide invasive species, are tolerant to Bd and serve as a reservoir host for Bd during winter months and subsequently infect native species that return to breed in spring. Using outdoor mesocosms, we experimentally examined if two strains of Bd could overwinter in aquatic systems, in the presence or absence of bullfrog tadpoles, and if overwintered Bd could be transmitted to tadpoles of two spring-breeding species: Pacific treefrogs (\n              Pseudacris regilla\n              ) and Cascades frogs (\n              Rana cascadae\n              ). We found that only 4 of 448 total animals (one bullfrog and three spring breeders) tested positive for Bd after overwintering. Moreover, two of the three infected spring breeders emerged from tanks that contained overwintered Bd but in the absence of infected bullfrogs. This suggests that Bd can persist over winter without bullfrogs as a reservoir host. We found no effect of Bd strain on bullfrog survival after overwintering. For Pacific treefrogs, Bd exposure did not significantly affect mass at or time to metamorphosis while exposure to bullfrogs reduced survival. For Cascades frogs, we found an interactive effect of Bd strain and bullfrog presence on time to metamorphosis, but no main or interactive effects on their survival or mass at metamorphosis. In short, bullfrog tadpoles rarely retained and transmitted Bd infection in our experiment and we found limited evidence that Bd successfully overwinters in the absence of bullfrog tadpoles and infects spring-breeding amphibians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Devin K."},{"family":"Urbina","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Cothran","given":"Ricky D."},{"family":"Harjoe","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Mattes","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Buck","given":"Julia C."},{"family":"Bendis","given":"Randall"},{"family":"Dang","given":"Trang"},{"family":"Gervasi","given":"Stephanie S."},{"family":"Relyea","given":"Rick"}],"citation-key":"blaustein2020","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-020-02218-4","ISSN":"1387-3547, 1573-1464","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5]]},"language":"en","page":"1771-1784","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of invasive larval bullfrogs (<i>Rana <span class=\"nocase\">catesbeiana</span></i>) on disease transmission, growth and survival in the larvae of native amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10530-020-02218-4","volume":"22"},

Amphibians are currently threatened by the rapid global spread of the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis. Bioaugmentation of locally occurring protective bacteria on amphibians has mitigated this disease effectively in laboratory trials and one recent ﬁeld trial. Areas still na€ıve to Bd provide an opportunity for conservationists to proactively implement probiotic strategies to prevent further amphibian declines. In areas where Bd is endemic, bioaugmentation can facilitate repatriation of susceptible amphibians currently maintained in assurance colonies. Here, we synthesise the current research in amphibian microbial ecology and bioaugmentation to identify characteristics of effective probiotics in relation to their interactions with Bd, their host, other resident microbes and the environment. To target at-risk species and amphibian communities, we develop sampling strategies and ﬁltering protocols that result in probiotics that inhibit Bd under ecologically relevant conditions and persist on susceptible amphibians.

  {"id":"blooi2017","abstract":"The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) drives declines and extinctions in amphibian communities. However, not all regions and species are equally affected. Here, we show that association with amphibian aquatic habitat types (bromeliad phytotelmata versus stream) across Central America results in the odds of being threatened by Bd being five times higher in stream microhabitats. This differential threat of Bd was supported in our study by a significantly lower prevalence of Bd in bromeliad-associated amphibian species compared to riparian species in Honduran cloud forests. Evidence that the bromeliad environment is less favorable for Bd transmission is exemplified by significantly less suitable physicochemical conditions and higher abundance of Bd-ingesting micro-eukaryotes present in bromeliad water. These factors may inhibit aquatic Bd zoospore survival and the development of an environmental reservoir of the pathogen. Bromeliad phytotelmata thus may act as environmental refuges from Bd, which contribute to protecting associated amphibian communities against chytridiomycosis-driven amphibian declines that threaten the nearby riparian communities.

Montane amphibian species, particularly those with narrow distributions and speciﬁc habitat requirements are likely to be at particular risk under future climate change scenarios. Despite this, fundamental ecological data are lacking for most of these species. Philoria kundagungan is a poorly known representative of a range-restricted genus of montane amphibians from eastern Australia. Using an occupancy framework, we conducted repeated call playback surveys at 32 sites across the mountainous regions of south-east Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, Australia, to investigate: (1) the current extent of this species’ geographic range, and (2) environmental predictors of this species’ presence. We found that P. kundagungan has a highly restricted and fragmented distribution, being limited to ~11 km2 of potentially suitable habitat, and that its presence is strongly associated with high elevation (>800 m). Our survey protocol resulted in a high probability of detection (>70%) at occupied sites from relatively few visits. From these baseline data, future studies will have the ability to determine changes in this species’ geographic range and occupancy rate in response to the ever-increasing threats faced by P. kundagungan, thereby supporting more effective conservation strategies and policy decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolitho","given":"Liam J."},{"family":"Rowley","given":"Jodi J.

This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simpliﬁcations. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantiﬁed the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population’s niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reﬂecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population’s stability, the amount of intraspeciﬁc competition, ﬁtness-function shapes, and the population’s capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.","author":[{"family":"Bolnick","given":"Daniel I."},{"family":"Svanbäck","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Fordyce","given":"James A."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Louie H."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Jeremy M."}],"citation-key":"bolnick2003","container-title":"The American Naturalist","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-28","source":"Zotero","title":"The ecology of individuals: incidence and implications of individual specialization","type":"article-journal","volume":"161"},

Although artiﬁcial refuges are intended to support particular species, they may be equally attractive and accessible to others, including predators. We explored the inﬂuence of snake predation risk and shelter attributes on the overnight use of different artiﬁcial refuges (timber, tiles, and iron) using the predator-prey relationship between Boulenger’s skink, Morethia boulengeri and the curl snake, Suta suta. We collected adult M. boulengeri from two bioregions in south-eastern Australia: the Riverina, where the two species co-occur, and the South Western Slopes, where S. suta does not occur. Two adult S. suta were collected for use as chemical donors. We conducted four experiments on overnight refuge choice to determine: (i) predator-scent avoidance, (ii) artiﬁcial refuge preferences, (iii) a trade-off between a preferred refuge and predator-avoidance, and (iv) the effect of gap height on refuge preference. We found that skinks avoided predator-scented refuges in favour of identical, but unscented refuges. Skinks preferred timber refuges, and most skinks maintained this preference when predator-scent was added. However, when gap height was manipulated, skinks shifted to the refuge with the smallest gap. Skinks displayed complex regional variation in behaviour; skinks from both bioregions avoided predator-scent, but in the trade-off experiment, skinks from the South Western Slopes were less likely to avoid predator-scented timber refuges than those from the Riverina. Our ﬁndings suggest that protective refuge attributes, such as small gap height, can offset the risk implied by predator-scent within a refuge. This study highlights the need to consider predator-prey interactions when designing and using artiﬁcial refuges for habitat restoration or biological monitoring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bourke","given":"Gaye"},{"family":"Matthews","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Michael","given":"Damian R."}],"citation-key":"bourke2017","container-title":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/aec.12469","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]},"language":"en","page":"497-507","source":"Crossref","title":"Can protective attributes of artificial refuges offset predation risk in lizards?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/aec.12469","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"bovo2018","abstract":"Several amphibian lineages epitomize the faunal biodiversity crises, with numerous reports of population declines and extinctions worldwide. Predicting how such lineages will cope with environmental changes is an urgent challenge for biologists. A promising framework for this involves mechanistic modeling, which integrates organismal ecophysiological features and ecological models as a means to establish causal and consequential relationships of species with their physical environment. Solid frameworks built for other tetrapods (e.g., lizards) have proved successful in this context, but its extension to amphibians requires care. First, the natural history of amphibians is distinct within tetrapods, for it includes a biphasic life cycle that undergoes major habitat transitions and changes in sensitivity to environmental factors. Second, the accumulated data on amphibian ecophysiology is not nearly as expressive, is heavily biased towards adult lifeforms of few non-tropical lineages, and overlook the importance of hydrothermal relationships. Thus, we argue that critical usage and improvement in the available data is essential for enhancing the power of mechanistic modeling from the physiological ecology of amphibians. We highlight the complexity of ecophysiological variables and the need for understanding the natural history of the group under study and indicate directions deemed crucial to attaining steady progress in this ﬁeld.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bovo","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Navas","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Tejedo","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Valença","given":"Saulo"},{"family":"Gouveia","given":"Sidney"}],"citation-key":"bovo2018","container-title":"Diversity","DOI":"10.3390/d10040118","ISSN":"1424-2818","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,26]]},"language":"en","page":"118","source":"Crossref","title":"Ecophysiology of amphibians: information for best mechanistic models","title-short":"Ecophysiology of Amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/10/4/118","volume":"10"},

However, determining the relative importance of host traits to explain this heterogeneity is a challenge. One ecologically important pathogen is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis and has been associated with many amphibian population declines worldwide. For many hosts, post-metamorphic stages are generally more susceptible than the larval stage. Yet, examination of the effects of Bd infection at different ages within a life stage, has received little attention. This study investigated the hypothesis that recently-post-metamorphic frogs were more sensitive to chytridiomycosis than older frogs, and that sensitivity to Bd infection decreased as frogs aged. We examined this relationship with Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) and red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Age had a strong effect on susceptibility to infection, infection intensity, and survival–but not in the directions we had predicted. In both host species, an increase in age was associated with frogs becoming more susceptible to Bd infection, harboring larger infection intensities, and greater risk of mortality. This suggests that the timing of Bd exposure may influence amphibian population dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bradley","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."}],"citation-key":"bradley2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0222181","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e0222181","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Host age alters amphibian susceptibility to <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i>, an emerging infectious fungal pathogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222181","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"bradstock2008","abstract":"Large fires coincident with drought occurred in south-eastern Australia during 2001–2007. Perceptions of large, intense fires as being ecologically ‘disastrous’ are common. These are summarised by four hypotheses characterising large fires as: (i) homogenous in extent and intensity; (ii) causing large-scale extinction due to perceived lack of survival and regeneration capacity among biota; (iii) degrading due to erosion and related edaphic effects; (iv) unnatural, as a consequence of contemporary land management. These hypotheses are examined using available evidence and shown to inadequately account for effects of large fires on biodiversity. Large fires do not burn homogeneously, though they may produce intensely burnt patches and areas. The bulk of biota are resilient through a variety of in situ persistence mechanisms that are reinforced by landscape factors. Severe erosive episodes following fire tend to be local and uncertain rather than global and inevitable. Redistribution of soil and nutrients may reinforce habitat variation in some cases. Signals of fire are highly variable over prehistoric and historic eras, and, in some cases, contemporary and pre-European signal levels are equivalent. The most important effects of large fires in these diverse ecological communities and landscapes stem from their recurrence rate. Adaptive management of fire regimes rather than fire events is required, based on an understanding of risks posed by particular regimes to biota.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bradstock","given":"Ross A."}],"citation-key":"bradstock2008","container-title":"International Journal of Wildland Fire","DOI":"10.1071/WF07153","ISSN":"1049-8001","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"809-822","source":"Crossref","title":"Effects of large fires on biodiversity in south-eastern Australia: disaster or template for diversity?","title-short":"Effects of large fires on biodiversity in south-eastern Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WF07153","volume":"17"},

Crayfish are hosts of this pathogen and can transmit Bd to amphibians. Because they co-occur with susceptible amphibian communities, crayfish may be important alternative hosts for Bd. Understanding the prevalence and seasonal dynamics of crayfish infections is of agricultural and ecological interest in areas where crayfish are farmed and traded for human consumption. We conducted a survey of Bd in farmed and natural crayfish (Procambarus spp.) populations in Louisiana, USA. We found that Bd prevalence and infection intensity was low in both farmed and native populations and that prevalence varied seasonally in wild Louisiana crayfish.

Between 6 and 9 months post-release, we recaptured 4.83% of the released animals, and observed breeding at all sites. Both released and extant animals had similar susceptibility to infection; both groups increased in Bd infection prevalence and infection intensity throughout the breeding season. We did not detect any effect on survival by site of release; however, population of origin had a relatively large impact (ω = 0.454), and animals from one Bd-exposed population were recaptured signiﬁcantly more than the animals from the other Bd-exposed population and the Bd-naive population.

However, little is known about the interaction between Bd and cane toads. We aimed to explore the interaction of these 2 species in 3 parts. First, we collated data from the literature on Bd infection in wild cane toads. Second, we tested the susceptibility of recently metamorphosed cane toads to Bd infection. Finally, we modelled the distribution of the 2 species in Australia to identify where they overlap and, therefore, might interact. Through our data collation, we found that adult cane toads are infrequently infected and do not carry high infection burdens; however, our infection experiment showed that metamorphs are highly susceptible to infection and disease, but resistance appears to increase with increasing toad size. Niche modelling revealed overlapping distributions and the potential for cane toads to be affected by chytridiomycosis in the wild. While Bd can cause mortality in small juveniles in the laboratory, warm microhabitats used by wild toads likely prevent infection, and furthermore, high mortality of juveniles is unlikely to affect the adult populations because they are highly fecund. However, to demonstrate the impact of Bd on wild cane toad populations, targeted field studies are required to assess (1) the overall impact of chytridiomycosis on recruitment especially in cooler areas more favourable for Bd and (2) whether cane toad juveniles can amplify Bd exposure of native amphibian species in these areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Brannelly","given":"L.

  {"id":"brannelly2018a","abstract":"Amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by infection with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is the most devastating vertebrate disease on record. Reservoir hosts are likely to be important in the Bd-amphibian system because many amphibian species can carry infections without experiencing mortality. However, while a variety of reservoirs have been proposed, few have been empirically demonstrated to act as competent reservoir hosts. In this study, we investigate whether the common eastern froglet, Crinia signifera, a non-declining species that is widespread in eastern Australia, is a reservoir host for Bd infection. We conducted a long-term, large-scale ﬁeld survey to investigate disease dynamics in C. signifera at sites where four sympatric, threatened anuran species have severely declined. We also monitored Bd-infected C. signifera in the laboratory to determine susceptibility and survivorship. Finally, we assessed population age structure to investigate disease impact in the wild. We found that C. signifera is a competent reservoir host, maintaining high prevalence and infection intensities in the wild and in the laboratory, with no signs of sub-lethal effects or clinical disease. In the wild, the modal age is 4 years with individuals living up to 6 years, indicating that adults can survive across multiple years despite high infection prevalence and intensity. The occurrence of C. signifera at sites with remnant populations of threatened species likely contributes to ongoing disease impact in declining species decades after the arrival of Bd. The presence of C. signifera at sites where threatened species have become extinct inhibits effective reintroductions, and we recommend avoiding sites with high reservoir host abundance when planning reintroductions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Brannelly","given":"L.

Here we compared different DNA extraction methods to determine the threshold for Bd detection and identify an optimal extraction method to improve detection and quantification of the pathogen. We extracted lab-created cell suspension standards using PrepMan Ultra, Chelex resin, and 3 spin column DNA extraction kits (Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue, Zymo Quick DNA miniprep, and IBI gMAX mini kit), and further compared extraction methods using field-collected samples. We found that when extracting Bd DNA from cells in lab-created culture, the spin column extraction methods and PrepMan Ultra were equivalent, while the resin method detected higher Bd DNA quantities, especially at higher loads. However, when swabs from live animals were analyzed, low Bd quantities were more than twice as likely to be detected using a spin column extraction than with the PrepMan Ultra extraction method. All tested spin column extraction methods performed similarly across both field and lab samples. Samples containing low Bd quantities yielded inconsistent detection and quantification of Bd DNA copies regardless of extraction method. To manage imperfect detection of Bd, we suggest that presence/absence analyses are more informative than attempting to quantify Bd DNA when quantities are low. Overall, we recommend that a cost−benefit analysis of target species susceptibility and epidemiology be taken into consideration when designing an experiment to determine the most appropriate DNA extraction method to be used, because sometimes detecting low Bd quantities is imperative to the study, whereas in other situations, detecting low DNA quantities is less important.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Brannelly","given":"Laura A."},{"family":"Wetzel","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"West","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Richards-Zawacki","given":"Corinne L."}],"citation-key":"brannelly2020","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao03482","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,4]]},"language":"en","page":"233-243","source":"Crossref","title":"Optimized <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> DNA extraction of swab samples results in imperfect detection particularly when infection intensities are low","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v139/p233-243/","volume":"139"},

We review the full breadth of mechanisms allowing host persistence, and synthesise research on host, pathogen, environmental and community factors driving persistence following chytridiomycosis-related declines and overview the current evidence and the information required to support each mechanism. We found that for most species the mechanisms facilitating persistence have not been identiﬁed. We illustrate how the mechanisms that drive long-term host population dynamics determine the most effective conservation management strategies.

  {"id":"brennan2020","abstract":"Organismal interactions drive the accumulation of diversity by inﬂuencing species ranges, morphology, and behavior. Interactions vary from agonistic to cooperative and should result in predictable 25 patterns in trait and range evolution. However, despite a conceptual understanding of these processes, they have been diﬃcult to model, particularly on macroevolutionary timescales and across broad geographic spaces. Here we investigate the inﬂuence of biotic interactions on trait evolution and community assembly in monitor lizards (Varanus). Monitors are an iconic radiation with a cosmopolitan distribution and the greatest size disparity of any living terrestrial vertebrate genus. 30 Between the colossal Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis and the smallest Australian dwarf goannas, Varanus length and mass vary by multiple orders of magnitude. To test the hypothesis that size variation in this genus was driven by character displacement, we extended existing phylogenetic comparative methods which consider lineage interactions to account for dynamic biogeographic history and apply these methods to Australian monitors and marsupial predators. We use a 35 phylogenomic approach to estimate the relationships among living and extinct varaniform lizards, incorporating both exon-capture molecular and morphological datasets. Our results suggest that communities of Australian Varanus show high functional diversity as a result of continent-wide interspeciﬁc competition among monitors but not with faunivorous marsupials. We demonstrate that patterns of trait evolution resulting from character displacement on continental scales are 40 recoverable from comparative data and highlight that these macroevolutionary patterns may develop in parallel across widely distributed sympatric groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Brennan","given":"Ian G."},{"family":"Lemmon","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Lemmon","given":"Emily Moriarty"},{"family":"Portik","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Weijola","given":"Valter"},{"family":"Welton","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Donnellan","given":"Stephen C."},{"family":"Keogh","given":"J.Scott"}],"citation-key":"brennan2020","DOI":"10.1101/2020.02.02.931188","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,3]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Evolutionary Biology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phylogenomics of monitor lizards and the role of competition in dictating body size disparity","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.02.02.931188"},

Using 4,785 terrestrial mammal species, we show that range contraction results in niche space and habitat diversity loss. Additionally, ecological marginalization is a common consequence of range contraction caused by human land use change. Remnant populations become located in the climatic and topographic extremes of their historic niche that are more likely to be at the periphery of their historic niche at greater distances from historic niche centroids. This ecological marginalization is associated with poor performance and increased extinction risk independent of geographic range loss.

Based on N-mixture model analyses, abundance and movement of Six-lined Race Runners (Cnemidophorus [Aspidoscelis] sexlineatus) and Southern Prairie Lizards (Sceloporus consobrinus) were not significantly different before versus shortly after the wildfire. A capture-recapture analysis indicated that movement rates were higher in the wildfire zone for Hurter’s Spadefoot Toads (Scaphiopus hurterii) the following spring. Based on the trap data, herpetofaunal species composition was not significantly different shortly after the fire or subsequently, during the following spring. However, the anuran call survey data indicated that anuran species richness was higher in the wildfire zone. Overall, we did not find reduced abundance or diversity of herpetofauna after the fire, a positive result for conservation in this ecoregion.

  {"id":"brown2014a","abstract":"Historically ﬁre was an important natural disturbance shaping the structure and composition of pine-dominated forests in the southern United States. Longstanding ﬁre suppression policies have resulted in structural and compositional changes, notably accumulation of heavy fuel loads and reduction in vegetation species diversity. Primary goals of forest management through prescribed burning include fuel load reduction and mimicking ecosystem impacts of historically natural wildﬁres. In addition to the inﬂuences of ﬁre frequency and season, the inﬂuence of ﬁre severity on ecosystem responses is currently of interest. In this study we sought to quantify the impacts of low, moderate, and high severity ﬁres, and their interaction with prior forest management practices, to several aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem components of a southern U.S. mixed pine/hardwood forest using a before–after, control-impact (BACI) approach. The ecosystem components we assessed were water quality, community composition of aquatic arthropods (wildﬁre impacts only), forest structure characteristics, community composition of understory vegetation, and community composition of ground-dwelling arthropods. We found that increasing ﬁre severity increased aquatic nutrient levels and productivity, but the magnitude of effects increased with severity. Low and moderate severity ﬁres had weak effects on forest structure characteristics, community composition of understory vegetation, and community composition of ground-dwelling arthropods in the initial years following burns. In contrast, high severity ﬁres dramatically reduced ﬁne and large fuel loads, increased diversity of understory vegetation, and inﬂuenced community composition of ground-dwelling arthropods. Further, wildﬁre severity was reduced in areas with a prior moderate severity prescribed burn, but not in areas with a prior low severity prescribed burn. Our results provide quantitative evidence for the role of ﬁre severity as a primary factor inﬂuencing responses of ecosystems to ﬁre, and indicate that forest management practices inﬂuence the impact of high severity ﬁres on ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Donald J."},{"family":"Nowlin","given":"Weston H."},{"family":"Ozel","given":"Emrah"},{"family":"Mali","given":"Ivana"},{"family":"Episcopo","given":"Dionne"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Melissa C."},{"family":"Forstner","given":"Michael R.J."}],"citation-key":"brown2014a","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.006","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1]]},"language":"en","page":"179-192","source":"Crossref","title":"Comparison of short term low, moderate, and high severity fire impacts to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem components of a southern USA mixed pine/hardwood forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112713006737","volume":"312"},
  {"id":"brown2020","abstract":"Comparative biological studies often investigate the morphological, physiological or ecological divergence (or overlap) between entities such as species or populations. Here we discuss the weaknesses of using existing methods to analyse patterns of phenotypic overlap and present a novel method to analyse co-occurrence in multidimensional space. We propose a ‘hyperoverlap’ framework to detect qualitative overlap (or divergence) between point datasets and present the hyperoverlap r package which implements this framework, including functions for visualization. hyperoverlap uses support vector machines (SVMs) to train a classifier based on point data (such as morphological or ecological data) for two entities. This classifier finds the optimal boundary between the two sets of data and compares the predictions to the original labels. Misclassification is an evidence of overlap between the two entities. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of this method compared to existing approaches (e.g. single-entity hypervolume models) using the bioclimatic data extracted from global occurrence records of conifers. We find that there are instances where single-entity hypervolume models predict overlap, but there are no observations of either entity in the shared hypervolume. In these instances, hyperoverlap reports nonoverlap. We show that our method is stable and less likely to be affected by sampling biases than current approaches. We also find that hyperoverlap is particularly effective for situations involving entities with a small number of data points (e.g. narrowly endemic species) for which single-entity models cannot be reliably constructed. We argue that overlap can be reliably detected using hyperoverlap, particularly for descriptive studies. The method proposed here is a valuable tool for studying patterns of overlap in a multidimensional space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Matilda J.

Snakes may overwinter alone or aggregate in communal hibernacula to avoid temperature extremes. Limited information is available regarding the overwintering ecology of rattlesnakes, and basic demographic information is necessary for understanding population dynamics, habitat requirements, and management of rattlesnakes. Even less is known about the demographics of species and populations utilizing artificial hibernacula, which may become increasingly important as habitat is lost and/or becomes more fragmented. We used seven years of mark–recapture data of the Western Rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) at an artificial hibernaculum to estimate annual apparent survival, encounter rates, and transition rates between life stages (mature vs. immature) to investigate how these rates vary over time and in response to drought conditions. Further, we described trends in body condition and age structure, as well as trends in the proportion of reproductive females. Apparent survival rates were consistent and high across the study period for all snakes (including immature and mature females and all males; 0.66). The probability of an immature female surviving and transitioning to a mature adult was high and consistent across the study period (0.73). The stable survival and transition rates observed in this study may indicate other demographic rates, such as reproductive output, may be important drivers of population dynamics. This study contributes basic knowledge about population dynamics of communally overwintering rattlesnakes and suggests survival rates were relatively stable for snakes regularly utilizing this artificial hibernaculum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruckerhoff","given":"Lindsey A."},{"family":"Kamees","given":"Larry K."},{"family":"Holycross","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Painter","given":"Charles W."}],"citation-key":"bruckerhoff2021","container-title":"Ichthyology & Herpetology","container-title-short":"cope.1","DOI":"10.1643/h2019301","ISSN":"2766-1512, 2766-1520","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"page":"64-74","publisher":"The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists","source":"bioone.org","title":"Patterns of survival of a communally overwintering rattlesnake using an artificial hibernaculum","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/ichthyology-and-herpetology/volume-109/issue-1/h2019301/Patterns-of-Survival-of-a-Communally-Overwintering-Rattlesnake-Using-an/10.1643/h2019301.full","volume":"109"},

Because transmission generally requires close contact, host movements and behaviors can shape transmission dynamics: random and complete mixing leads to the classic density-d­ependent model, but if hosts primarily interact locally (e.g., aggregate) or within groups, transmission may saturate. Manipulating host behavior may thus change both the rate and functional form of transmission. We used the ranavirus–wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpole system to test whether transmission rates reflect contacts, and whether the functional form of transmission can be influenced by the distribution of food in mesocosms (widely dispersed, promoting random movement and mixing vs. a central pile, promoting aggregations). Contact rates increased with density, as expected, but transmission rapidly saturated. Observed rates of transmission were not explained by observed contact rates or the density-d­ ependent model, but instead transmission in both treatments followed models allowing for heterogeneities in the transmission process. We argue that contacts were not generally limiting, but instead that our results are better explained by heterogeneities in host susceptibility.

This potential often goes unrealised because the habitat value of regrowth is generally considered marginal. However, the habitat value of regrowth varies among taxa. Disturbed subtropical woodland landscapes provide large-scale passive restoration opportunities. Subtropical woodlands are also rich in reptile diversity. We addressed the question: ‘What is the habitat value of subtropical regrowth woodlands for reptile communities?’ We identified five commonly-observed models of regrowth habitat value and then surveyed reptile communities in 43 cleared, regrowth and remnant Acaciaand Eucalyptus-dominated woodland sites in subtropical Queensland, Australia. Reptile species richness, diversity, dominance and community composition followed the “regrowth = remnant” model of high regrowth value, where the habitat values of regrowth and remnant woodlands were similar, and higher than that of cleared land. Unexpectedly, the proportion of juveniles was highest in cleared sites and lower in both regrowth and remnant sites. Our findings challenge the view that the habitat value of regrowth is limited. Consistency in findings between contrasting woodland types suggest that our results may apply in other similarly disturbed woodlands. We conclude that although remnant woodlands are irreplaceable, regrowth woodlands provide valuable habitat for reptile communities and the protection of such regrowth should be a high priority in disturbed subtropical woodland systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruton","given":"Melissa J."},{"family":"McAlpine","given":"Clive A."},{"family":"Maron","given":"Martine"}],"citation-key":"bruton2013a","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2013.05.018","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"language":"en","page":"95-103","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Regrowth woodlands are valuable habitat for reptile communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320713001687","volume":"165"},
  {"id":"bruton2014","abstract":"For effective fauna conservation and management, ecologists are required to identify the resources that are critical for species to survive, and consider how these are distributed across landscapes. The critical resources usually considered are food and water, but the availability of appropriate shelter resources can be a key driver of habitat suitability for terrestrial reptiles and amphibians. Reptiles are important components of dryland ecosystems, yet we have little understanding about how anthropogenic disturbances affect the availability of shelter resources and reptile survival in drylands. In this study, we used VHF radio-tracking to assess the importance of shelter resources in determining the habitat use patterns of a Near-Threatened reptile species, the woma (Aspidites ramsayi; Pythonidae), in modiﬁed and intact dryland landscapes of Queensland, Australia. We compared the structural and thermal attributes of locations that were used, with those that were available. Using an information-theoretic approach, we found that the occurrence of womas was strongly associated with the presence of ground burrows, which are excellent thermal insulators. No other shelter type was capable of buffering our study species from sub-zero temperatures during winter, although summer temperatures of >40°C were buffered by hollow logs and piles of woody debris. Habitat use patterns were inﬂuenced more by the occurrence of underground shelters than by habitat type. Clearing status per se (cleared, regrowth or intact) had minimal inﬂuence on occurrence.Thermally buffered underground shelters are a vital resource for our focal species, and the availability of this shelter resource drives habitat suitability in modiﬁed dryland landscapes. Due to the key trophic role of reptiles in dryland ecosystems, and the excellent thermal buffering capacity of underground shelters, we propose that ground burrows may be potentially considered as keystone structures in drylands, and require a similar level of protection to ‘habitat’ or ‘legacy’ trees in forested ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruton","given":"Melissa J."},{"family":"McAlpine","given":"Clive A."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Craig E."}],"citation-key":"bruton2014","container-title":"Austral Ecology","container-title-short":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/aec.12150","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"language":"en","page":"819-829","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The importance of underground shelter resources for reptiles in dryland landscapes: A woma python case study: Shelter resources for dryland reptiles","title-short":"The importance of underground shelter resources for reptiles in dryland landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aec.12150","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"buck2016","abstract":"Anthropogenic stressors may influence hosts and their pathogens directly or may alter host–pathogen dynamics indirectly through interactions with other species. For example, in aquatic ecosystems, eutrophication may be associated with increased or decreased disease risk. Conversely, pathogens can influence community structure and function and are increasingly recognised as important members of the ecological communities in which they exist. In outdoor mesocosms, we experimentally manipulated nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and the presence of a fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and examined the effects on Bd abundance on larval amphibian hosts (Pseudacris regilla: Hylidae), amphibian traits and community dynamics. We predicted that resource supplementation would mitigate negative effects of Bd on tadpole growth and development and that indirect effects of treatments would propagate through the community. Nutrient additions caused changes in algal growth, which benefitted tadpoles through increased mass, development and survival. Bd-exposed tadpoles metamorphosed sooner than unexposed individuals, but their mass at metamorphosis was not affected by Bd exposure. We detected additive rather than interactive effects of nutrient supplementation and Bd in this experiment. Nutrient supplementation was not a significant predictor of infection load of larval amphibians. However, a structural equation model revealed that resource supplementation and exposure of amphibians to Bd altered the structure of the aquatic community. This is the first demonstration that sublethal effects of Bd on amphibians can alter aquatic community dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Buck","given":"Julia C."},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."},{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."}],"citation-key":"buck2016","container-title":"Freshwater Biology","DOI":"10.1111/fwb.12685","ISSN":"1365-2427","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"110-120","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Effects of nutrient supplementation on host-pathogen dynamics of the amphibian chytrid fungus: a community approach","title-short":"Effects of nutrient supplementation on host-pathogen dynamics of the amphibian chytrid fungus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fwb.12685","volume":"61"},

In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage.

  {"id":"bury2004","abstract":"The herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) of northwestern forests (U.S.A.) is diverse, and many species are locally abundant. Most forest amphibians west of the Cascade Mountain crest are associated with cool, cascading streams or coarse woody material on the forest floor, which are characteristics of mature forests. Extensive loss and fragmentation of habitat resulted from logging across approximately 50% of oldgrowth forests in northern California and approximately 80% of stands in Oregon and Washington. There is a complex landscape mosaic and overlap of northern and southern biotic elements in the Klamath-Siskiyou Region along the Oregon and California border, creating a biodiversity hotspot. The region experiences many low-severity fires annually, punctuated by periodic major fires, including the Biscuit fire, the largest in North America in 2002. In the fire’s northern portion, severe fire occurred on >50% of stands of young, managed trees but on only about 25–33% of old-growth stands. This suggests that the legacy of timber harvest may produce fire-prone stands. Calls for prescribed fire and thinning to reduce fuel loads will remove large amounts of coarse woody material from forests, which reduces cover for amphibians and alters nutrient inputs to streams. Our preliminary evidence suggests no negative effects of wildfire on terrestrial amphibians, but stream amphibians decrease following wildfire. Most reptiles are adapted to open terrain, so fire usually improves their habitat. Today, the challenge is to maintain biodiversity in western forests in the face of intense political pressures designed to “prevent” catastrophic fires. We need a dedicated research effort to understanding how fire affects biota and to proactively investigate outcomes of fuel-reduction management on wildlife in western forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bury","given":"R.

  {"id":"byrne2019","abstract":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd] is one of the most devastating wildlife pathogens ever documented. Most surveys for Bd report only the presence/absence of the pathogen. However, Bd has distinct genetic lineages that vary in geographic extent and virulence, thus reporting Bd presence alone is not particularly informative. Our study uses a custom method for genotyping degraded Bd DNA samples, such as those nondestructively collected from live animal or museum specimen skin swabs, and presents the discovery of a divergent lineage of Bd—BdASIA3. This study advances our understanding of the evolutionary origins of Bd, highlights areas of the world where Bd lineages are coming into contact, and opens the door to affordable, rapid genetic monitoring of this pathogen.Biodiversity loss is one major outcome of human-mediated ecosystem disturbance. One way that humans have triggered wildlife declines is by transporting disease-causing agents to remote areas of the world. Amphibians have been hit particularly hard by disease due in part to a globally distributed pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd]). Prior research has revealed important insights into the biology and distribution of Bd; however, there are still many outstanding questions in this system. Although we know that there are multiple divergent lineages of Bd that differ in pathogenicity, we know little about how these lineages are distributed around the world and where lineages may be coming into contact. Here, we implement a custom genotyping method for a global set of Bd samples. This method is optimized to amplify and sequence degraded DNA from noninvasive skin swab samples. We describe a divergent lineage of Bd, which we call BdASIA3, that appears to be widespread in Southeast Asia. This lineage co-occurs with the global panzootic lineage (BdGPL) in multiple localities. Additionally, we shed light on the global distribution of BdGPL and highlight the expanded range of another lineage, BdCAPE. Finally, we argue that more monitoring needs to take place where Bd lineages are coming into contact and where we know little about Bd lineage diversity. Monitoring need not use expensive or difficult field techniques but can use archived swab samples to further explore the history—and predict the future impacts—of this devastating pathogen.","author":[{"family":"Byrne","given":"Allison Q."},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."},{"family":"Martel","given":"An"},{"family":"Pasmans","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Bell","given":"Rayna C."},{"family":"Blackburn","given":"David C."},{"family":"Bletz","given":"Molly C."},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Cheryl J."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Rafe M."},{"family":"Catenazzi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Familiar López","given":"Mariel"},{"family":"Figueroa-Valenzuela","given":"Raul"},{"family":"Ghose","given":"Sonia L."},{"family":"Jaeger","given":"Jef R."},{"family":"Jani","given":"Andrea J."},{"family":"Jirku","given":"Miloslav"},{"family":"Knapp","given":"Roland A."},{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Portik","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Richards-Zawacki","given":"Corinne L."},{"family":"Rockney","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Rovito","given":"Sean M."},{"family":"Stark","given":"Tariq"},{"family":"Sulaeman","given":"Hasan"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Nguyen Thien"},{"family":"Voyles","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Waddle","given":"Anthony W."},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Zhiyong"},{"family":"Rosenblum","given":"Erica Bree"}],"citation-key":"byrne2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1908289116","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,18]]},"page":"6","title":"Cryptic diversity of a widespread global pathogen reveals expanded threats to amphibian conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/09/17/1908289116.abstract"},

The purpose of the Workshop was to: 1. provide an overview of the current status of knowledge about species which are declining; 2. provide an overview of what's known about the decline and how it is being tackled; 3. identify gaps in knowledge; 4. recommend priorities for notional effort for research, management and community attention; 5. help set future priority actions for the Working Group; and 6. establish on-going communication links between all participants and the wider community. Following the Workshop the Working Group met and emphasised: the need to maintain a broad perspective and to continue monitoring and research on a range of possible causal factors; the need to support research into new areas - particularly disease as a potentially major factor influencing global declines; the need to support strategic research and to develop protocols to address this issue; and the need to support research on fluctuating asymmetry as a possible early warning tool for predicting declines.

Amphibians are the most threatened group of vertebrates globally, and emerging infectious diseases play a large role in their continued population declines. Viruses belonging to the genus Ranavirus are responsible for one of the deadliest and most widespread of these diseases. To date, no work has used individual level data to investigate how ranaviruses affect population demographic structure. We used skeletochronology and morphology to evaluate the impact of ranaviruses on the age structure of populations of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) in the UK. We compared ecologically similar populations that differed most notably in their historical presence or absence of ranavirosis (the acute syndrome caused by ranavirus infection). Our results suggest that ranavirosis may truncate the age structure of R. temporaria populations. One potential explanation for such a shift might be increased adult mortality and subsequent shifts in the life history of younger age classes that increase reproductive output earlier in life. Additionally, we constructed population projection models which indicated that such increased adult mortality could heighten the vulnerability of frog populations to stochastic environmental challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Lewis J."},{"family":"Garner","given":"Trenton W.J."},{"family":"Tessa","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Scheele","given":"Benjamin C."},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Amber G.F."},{"family":"Wilfert","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Xavier A."}],"citation-key":"campbell2018","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.5949","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e5949","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An emerging viral pathogen truncates population age structure in a European amphibian and may reduce population viability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/5949","volume":"6"},

Our attitude toward that uncertainty, and the risks it entails, shape the way conservation decisions are made. Stochastic dominance (SD), a method more commonly used in economics, can be used to rank alternative conservation actions by comparing the probability distributions of their outcomes, making progressive simpliﬁed assumptions about the preferences of decision makers. Here, we illustrate the application of SD to conservation decisions using the recovery plan for an endangered frog species in Australia as a case study. SD is simple and intuitively appealing for conservation decisions; its broader application may encourage conservation decision makers to consider probabilistic uncertainty in light of their preferences, which may otherwise be difﬁcult to recognize and assess transparently.

  {"id":"caorsi2012","abstract":"The most common method for identifying individual amphibians is toe-clipping (TC), whereby captured individuals are marked by a unique combination of amputated phalanges that corresponds to a unique alphanumeric code. However, ethical and methodological objections to this method have been raised and there is broad interest in developing alternative methods. One alternative is to use photo-identification methods (PIMs) to identify individuals based on their natural markings. We tested the efficacy of TC and two PIMs — visual matching (VM) and computer-assisted matching (CAM) using the software Wild-ID — in identifying individual adults of the endangered southern red-bellied toad, Melanophryniscus cambaraensis. We collected data over 5 mo at Floresta Nacional de São Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. All specimens were toe-clipped and photographed. The total dataset included 492 captures of 147 individuals. VM was most accurate (99.4%), followed by TC (95.3%) and CAM (90.9%); VM was significantly more accurate than TC and CAM and TC was significantly more accurate than CAM. CAM accuracy diminished as dataset size increased but was considerably faster than VM. All CAM and VM errors were false negatives but involved different images; all TC errors were cross-identifications. Given that misidentifications occurred using both PIMs and TC, our results suggest that studies that require high accuracy should employ at least two methods to allow cross-validation. The performance of each method and the impacts of different kinds and rates of error on inferences depend on the organisms, field conditions, dataset sizes, and study questions.

This study documents the interactions between this pathogen and a susceptible amphibian host, the boreal toad (Bufo boreas). The amount of time following exposure until death is inﬂuenced by the dosage of infectious zoospores, duration of exposure, and body size of the toad. The signiﬁcant relation between dosage and the number of days survived (dose-response curve) supports the hypothesis that the degree of infection must reach a particular threshold of about 107–108 zoosporangia before death results. Variation in air temperature between 12°C and 23°C had no signiﬁcant effect on survival time. The infection can be transmitted from infected to healthy animals by contact with water containing zoospores; no physical contact between animals is required.

Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Goodrich","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Betancourt","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Jiqiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Riddell","given":"Allen"}],"citation-key":"carpenter2017","container-title":"Journal of Statistical Software","DOI":"10.18637/jss.v076.i01","ISSN":"1548-7660","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,11]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2017 Bob Carpenter, Andrew Gelman, Matthew D.

  {"id":"carvalho2020","abstract":"Hutchinson’s n-dimensional hypervolume concept holds a central role across different ﬁelds of ecology and evolution. The question of the amount of hypervolume overlap and differentiation between species is of great interest to understand the processes that drive niche dynamics, competitive interactions and, ultimately, community assembly. A framework is proposed to decompose overall differentiation among hypervolumes into two distinct components: niche shifts and niche contraction/expansion processes. Niche shift corresponds to the replacement of space between the hypervolumes occupied by two species, whereas niche contraction/expansion processes correspond to net differences between the amount of space enclosed by each hypervolume. A procedure to implement non-continuous trait data in the estimation of n-dimensional hypervolumes is proposed. Hypervolumes were constructed for three Darwin’ ﬁnches, Geospiza conirostris, Geospiza magnirostris, and Geospiza difﬁcilis using intraspeciﬁc trait data. Results showed that signiﬁcant niche shifts, not niche contraction, occurred between G. conirostris and G. magnirostris in Genovesa island, where they live in sympatry. This means that G. conirostris occupied a different niche space and not a reduced space on Genovesa. G. difﬁcilis was well differentiated from the other two species. The proposed framework allows disentangling different processes underlying niche partitioning between coexisting species. This framework offers novel insights to understand the drivers of niche partitioning strategies among coexisting species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Carvalho","given":"José Carlos"},{"family":"Cardoso","given":"Pedro"}],"citation-key":"carvalho2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"cashins2013","abstract":"Many amphibians have declined globally due to introduction of the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Hundreds of species, many in well-protected habitats, remain as small populations at risk of extinction. Currently the only proven conservation strategy is to maintain species in captivity to be reintroduced at a later date. However, methods to abate the disease in the wild are urgently needed so that reintroduced and wild animals can survive in the presence of Bd. Vaccination has been widely suggested as a potential strategy to improve survival. We used captive-bred offspring of critically endangered booroolong frogs (Litoria booroolongensis) to test if vaccination in the form of prior infection improves survival following re exposure. We infected frogs with a local Bd isolate, cleared infection after 30 days (d) using itraconazole just prior to the onset of clinical signs, and then re-exposed animals to Bd at 110 d. We found prior exposure had no effect on survival or infection intensities, clearly showing that real infections do not stimulate a protective adaptive immune response in this species. This result supports recent studies suggesting Bd may evade or suppress host immune functions. Our results suggest vaccination is unlikely to be useful in mitigating chytridiomycosis. However, survival of some individuals from all experimental groups indicates existence of protective innate immunity. Understanding and promoting this innate resistance holds potential for enabling species recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"McFadden","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David"},{"family":"Harlow","given":"Peter S."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."}],"citation-key":"cashins2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0056747","editor":[{"family":"Gratwicke","given":"Brian"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e56747","source":"Crossref","title":"Prior infection does not improve survival against the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056747","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"caswell2010","abstract":"1. Life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses decompose treatment effects on a dependent variable (usually, but not necessarily, population growth rate) into contributions from differences in the parameters that determine that variable. 2. Fixed, random and regression LTRE designs have been applied to plant populations in many contexts. These designs all make use of the derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the parameters, and describe differences as sums of linear approximations. 3. Here, I extend LTRE methods to analyse treatment effects on the stochastic growth rate log λs. The problem is challenging because a stochastic model contains two layers of dynamics: the stochastic dynamics of the environment and the response of the vital rates to the state of the environment. I consider the widely used case where the environment is described by a Markov chain. 4. As the parameters describing the environmental Markov chain do not appear explicitly in the calculation of log λs, derivatives cannot be calculated. The solution presented here combines derivatives for the vital rates with an alternative (and older) approach, due to Kitagawa and Keyfitz, that calculates contributions in a way analogous to the calculation of main effects in statistical models. 5. The resulting LTRE analysis decomposes log λs into contributions from differences in: (i) the stationary distribution of environmental states, (ii) the autocorrelation pattern of the environment, and (iii) the stage-specific vital rate responses within each environmental state. 6. As an example, the methods are applied to a stage-classified model of the prairie plant Lomatium bradshawii in a stochastic fire environment. 7. Synthesis. The stochastic growth rate is an important parameter describing the effects of environmental fluctuations on population viability. Like any growth rate, it responds to differences in environmental factors. Without a decomposition analysis there is no way to attribute differences in the stochastic growth rate to particular parts of the life cycle or particular aspects of the stochastic environment. The methods presented here provide such an analysis, extending the LTRE analyses already available for deterministic environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Caswell","given":"Hal"}],"citation-key":"caswell2010","container-title":"Journal of Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01627.x","ISSN":"1365-2745","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"324-333","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Life table response experiment analysis of the stochastic growth rate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01627.x","volume":"98"},
  {"id":"catenazzi2010","abstract":"Amphibians are declining worldwide, but these declines have been particularly dramatic in tropical mountains, where high endemism and vulnerability to an introduced fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is associated with amphibian extinctions. We surveyed frogs in the Peruvian Andes in montane forests along a steep elevational gradient (1200–3700 m). We used visual encounter surveys to sample stream-dwelling and arboreal species and leaf-litter plots to sample terrestrial-breeding species. We compared species richness and abundance among the wet seasons of 1999, 2008, and 2009. Despite similar sampling effort among years, the number of species (46 in 1999) declined by 47% between 1999 and 2008 and by 38% between 1999 and 2009. When we combined the number of species we found in 2008 and 2009, the decline from 1999 was 36%. Declines of stream-dwelling and arboreal species (a reduction in species richness of 55%) were much greater than declines of terrestrial-breeding species (reduction of 20% in 2008 and 24% in 2009). Similarly, abundances of stream-dwelling and arboreal frogs were lower in the combined 2008–2009 period than in 1999, whereas densities of frogs in leaf-litter plots did not differ among survey years. These declines may be associated with the infection of frogs with Bd. B. dendrobatidis prevalence correlated significantly with the proportion of species that were absent from the 2008 and 2009 surveys along the elevational gradient. Our results suggest Bd may have arrived at the site between 1999 and 2007, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this pathogen is spreading in epidemic waves along the Andean cordilleras. Our results also indicate a rapid decline of frog species richness and abundance in our study area, a national park that contains many endemic amphibian species and is high in amphibian species richness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Catenazzi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Lehr","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Lily O."},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."}],"citation-key":"catenazzi2010","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01604.x","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11]]},"language":"en","page":"382-391","source":"Crossref","title":"<i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> and the collapse of anuran species richness and abundance in the Upper Manu National Park, southeastern Peru","title-short":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and the Collapse of Anuran Species Richness and Abundance in the Upper Manu National Park, Southeastern Peru","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01604.x","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"catenazzi2013","abstract":"The amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is causing population declines and species extirpations worldwide. Montane amphibians in tropical and temperate regions are especially vulnerable to chytridiomycosis. High-elevation amphibian assemblages typically include few species, so that epizootics should be limited once high frog mortality hinders transmission of the pathogen. We hypothesized that tadpoles of a high-elevation frog in the Peruvian Andes, Telmatobius jelskii, could function as reservoir for Bd in Andean streams. We postulated that, for tadpoles to function as an efﬁcient reservoir of Bd, they should inhabit streams over extended periods of time, and have high prevalence of Bd. We surveyed streams between 2400 and 4850 m in the wet and dry seasons of 2010, where we captured, swabbed and determined the developmental stage of 458 tadpoles. We found that cohorts of tadpoles overlap continuously in these streams, as a consequence of multiple breeding events throughout the year. Prevalence of Bd among tadpoles averaged 53.1% (95% conﬁdence interval: 49.8–56.3%); 8 out of 13 streams inhabited by T. jelskii had a prevalence greater than 50%.

  {"id":"catenazzi2014","abstract":"Rising temperatures, a widespread consequence of climate change, have been implicated in enigmatic amphibian declines from habitats with little apparent human impact. The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Catenazzi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Lehr","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."}],"citation-key":"catenazzi2014","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12194","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"509-517","source":"Crossref","title":"Thermal physiology, disease, and amphibian declines on the eastern slopes of the Andes","title-short":"Thermal Physiology, Disease, and Amphibian Declines on the Eastern Slopes of the Andes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12194","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"catenazzi2017","abstract":"The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, has been linked to catastrophic amphibian declines throughout the world. Amphibians differ in their vulnerability to chytridiomycosis; some species experience epizootics followed by collapse while others exhibit stable host/pathogen dynamics where most amphibian hosts survive in the presence of Bd (e.g., in the enzootic state). Little is known about the factors that drive the transition between the two disease states within a community, or whether populations of species that survived the initial epizootic are stable, yet this information is essential for conservation and theory. Our study focuses on a diverse Peruvian amphibian community that experienced a Bd-caused collapse. We explore host/Bd dynamics of eight surviving species a decade after the mass extinction by using population level disease metrics and Bd-susceptibility trials. We found that three of the eight species continue to be susceptible to Bd, and that their populations are declining. Only one species is growing in numbers and it was non-susceptible in our trials. Our study suggests that some species remain vulnerable to Bd and exhibit ongoing population declines in enzootic systems where Bd-host dynamics are assumed to be stable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Catenazzi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Swei","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Finkle","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Foreyt","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Wyman","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."}],"citation-key":"catenazzi2017","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0186478","editor":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Benedikt R."}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,17]]},"language":"en","page":"e0186478","source":"Crossref","title":"Epizootic to enzootic transition of a fungal disease in tropical Andean frogs: Are surviving species still susceptible?","title-short":"Epizootic to enzootic transition of a fungal disease in tropical Andean frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186478","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"cayuela2022","abstract":"Habitat anthropization is a major driver of global biodiversity decline. Although most species are negatively affected, some benefit from anthropogenic habitat modifications by showing intriguing life-history responses. For instance, increased recruitment through higher allocation to reproduction or improved performance during early-life stages could compensate for reduced adult survival, corresponding to “compensatory recruitment”. To date, evidence of compensatory recruitment in response to habitat modification is restricted to plants, limiting understanding of its importance as a response to global change. We used the yellow-bellied toad (\n              Bombina variegata\n              ), an amphibian occupying a broad range of natural and anthropogenic habitats, as a model species to test for and to quantify compensatory recruitment. Using an exceptional capture–recapture dataset composed of 21,714 individuals from 67 populations across Europe, we showed that adult survival was lower, lifespan was shorter, and actuarial senescence was higher in anthropogenic habitats, especially those affected by intense human activities. Increased recruitment in anthropogenic habitats fully offset reductions in adult survival, with the consequence that population growth rate in both habitat types was similar. Our findings indicate that compensatory recruitment allows toad populations to remain viable in human-dominated habitats and might facilitate the persistence of other animal populations in such environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Cayuela","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Monod-Broca","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Lemaître","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Besnard","given":"Aurélien"},{"family":"Gippet","given":"Jérôme M.

  {"id":"cedergreen2005","abstract":"During the past two decades, the phenomenon of hormesis has gained increased recognition. To promote research in hormesis, a sound statistical quantiﬁcation of important parameters, such as the level and signiﬁcance of the increase in response and the range of concentration where it occurs, is strongly needed. Here, we present an improved statistical model to describe hormetic dose–response curves and test for the presence of hormesis. Using the delta method and freely available software, any percentage effect dose or concentration can be derived with its associated standard errors. Likewise, the maximal response can be extracted and the growth stimulation calculated. The new model was tested on macrophyte data from multiple-species experiments and on laboratory data of Lemna minor. For the 51 curves tested, signiﬁcant hormesis was detected in 18 curves, and for another 17 curves, the hormesis model described that data better than the logistic model did. The increase in response ranged from 5 to 109%. The growth stimulation occurred at an average dose somewhere between zero and concentrations corresponding to approximately 20 to 25% of the median effective concentration (EC50). Testing the same data with the hormesis model proposed by Brain and Cousens in 1989, we found no signiﬁcant hormesis. Consequently, the new model is shown to be far more robust than previous models, both in terms of variation in data and in terms of describing hormetic effects ranging from small effects of a 10% increase in response up to effects of an almost 100% increase in response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cedergreen","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Ritz","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Streibig","given":"Jens Carl"}],"citation-key":"cedergreen2005","container-title":"Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry","container-title-short":"Environ Toxicol Chem","DOI":"10.1897/05-014R.1","ISSN":"0730-7268, 1552-8618","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"3166-3172","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improved empirical models describing hormesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1897/05-014R.1","volume":"24"},

Although such individual variation in reproductive outcomes has been reported in numerous studies, most analyses to date have not considered whether these realized differences were due to latent individual heterogeneity in reproduction or merely random chance causing different outcomes among like individuals. Furthermore, latent heterogeneity in ﬁtness components might be expressed differently in contrasted environmental conditions, an issue that has only rarely been investigated. Here, we assessed (i) the potential existence of latent individual heterogeneity and (ii) the nature of its expression (ﬁxed vs. variable) in a population of female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), using a hierarchical modeling approach on a 30-year mark–recapture data set consisting of 954 individual encounter histories. We found strong support for the existence of latent individual heterogeneity in the population, with “robust” individuals expected to produce twice as many pups as “frail” individuals. Moreover, the expression of individual heterogeneity appeared consistent, with only mild evidence that it might be ampliﬁed when environmental conditions are severe. Finally, the explicit modeling of individual heterogeneity allowed us to detect a substantial cost of reproduction that was not evidenced when the heterogeneity was ignored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Chambert","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Rotella","given":"Jay J."},{"family":"Higgs","given":"Megan D."},{"family":"Garrott","given":"Robert A."}],"citation-key":"chambert2013","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.615","ISSN":"20457758","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","page":"2047-2060","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Individual heterogeneity in reproductive rates and cost of reproduction in a long-lived vertebrate","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.615","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"chambert2014","abstract":"The investigation of individual heterogeneity in vital rates has recently received growing attention among population ecologists. Individual heterogeneity in wild animal populations has been accounted for and quantiﬁed by including individually varying effects in models for mark–recapture data, but the real need for underlying individual effects to account for observed levels of individual variation has recently been questioned by the work of Tuljapurkar et al. (Ecology Letters, 12, 93, 2009) on dynamic heterogeneity. Model-selection approaches based on information criteria or Bayes factors have been used to address this question. Here, we suggest that, in addition to model-selection, model-checking methods can provide additional important insights to tackle this issue, as they allow one to evaluate a model’s misﬁt in terms of ecologically meaningful measures. Speciﬁcally, we propose the use of posterior predictive checks to explicitly assess discrepancies between a model and the data, and we explain how to incorporate model checking into the inferential process used to assess the practical implications of ignoring individual heterogeneity. Posterior predictive checking is a straightforward and ﬂexible approach for performing model checks in a Bayesian framework that is based on comparisons of observed data to model-generated replications of the data, where parameter uncertainty is incorporated through use of the posterior distribution. If discrepancy measures are chosen carefully and are relevant to the scientiﬁc context, posterior predictive checks can provide important information allowing for more efﬁcient model reﬁnement. We illustrate this approach using analyses of vital rates with long-term mark–recapture data for Weddell seals and emphasize its utility for identifying shortfalls or successes of a model at representing a biological process or pattern of interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chambert","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Rotella","given":"Jay J."},{"family":"Higgs","given":"Megan D."}],"citation-key":"chambert2014","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.993","ISSN":"2045-7758, 2045-7758","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"1389-1397","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Use of posterior predictive checks as an inferential tool for investigating individual heterogeneity in animal population vital rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.993","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"chandler2013","abstract":"Two contrasting strategies have been proposed for conserving biological diversity while meeting the increasing demand for agricultural products: land sparing and land sharing production systems. Land sparing involves increasing yield to reduce the amount of land needed for agriculture, whereas land-sharing agricultural practices incorporate elements of native ecosystems into the production system itself. Although the conservation value of these systems has been extensively debated, empirical studies are lacking. We compared bird communities in shade coffee, a widely practiced land-sharing system in which shade trees are maintained within the coffee plantation, with bird communities in a novel, small-scale, land-sparing coffee-production system (integrated open canopy or IOC coffee) in which farmers obtain higher yields under little or no shade while conserving an area of forest equal to the area under cultivation. Species richness and diversity of forest-dependent birds were higher in the IOC coffee farms than in the shade coffee farms, and community composition was more similar between IOC coffee and primary forest than between shade coffee and primary forest. Our study represents the first empirical comparison of well-defined land sparing and land sharing production systems. Because IOC coffee farms can be established by allowing forest to regenerate on degraded land, widespread adoption of this system could lead to substantial increases in forest cover and carbon sequestration without compromising agricultural yield or threatening the livelihoods of traditional small farmers. However, we studied small farms (<5 ha); thus, our results may not generalize to large-scale landsharing systems. Furthermore, rather than concluding that land sparing is generally superior to land sharing, we suggest that the optimal approach depends on the crop, local climate, and existing land-use patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chandler","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"King","given":"David I."},{"family":"Raudales","given":"Raul"},{"family":"Trubey","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Chandler","given":"Carlin"},{"family":"Arce Chávez","given":"Víctor Julio"}],"citation-key":"chandler2013","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12046","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"language":"en","page":"785-795","source":"Crossref","title":"A small-scale land-sparing approach to conserving biological diversity in tropical agricultural landscapes: land sparing and land sharing","title-short":"A small-scale land-sparing approach to conserving biological diversity in tropical agricultural landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12046","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"cheatsazan2013","abstract":"Background: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the causative agent of chytridiomycosis, is decimating amphibians worldwide. Unsurprisingly, the majority of studies have therefore concentrated on documenting morbidity and mortality of susceptible species and projecting population consequences as a consequence of this emerging infectious disease. Currently, there is a paucity of studies investigating the sub-lethal costs of Bd in apparently asymptomatic species, particularly in controlled experimental conditions. Here we report the consequences of a single dose of B. dendrobatidis zoospores on captive adult palmate newts (Lissotriton helveticus) for morphological and behavioural traits that associate with reproductive success.\nResults: A single exposure to ~2000 zoospores induced a subclinical Bd infection. One week after inoculation 84% of newts tested positive for Bd, and of those, 98% had apparently lost the infection by the day 30. However, exposed newts suffered significant mass loss compared with control newts, and those experimental newts removing higher levels of Bd lost most mass. We found no evidence to suggest that three secondary sexual characteristics (areas of dorsal crest and rear foot webbing, and length of tail filament) were reduced between experimental versus control newts; in fact, rear foot webbing was 26% more expansive at the end of the experiment in exposed newts. Finally, compared with unexposed controls, exposure to Bd was associated with a 50% earlier initiation of the non-reproductive terrestrial phase.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that Bd has measureable, but sub-lethal effects, on adult palmate newts, at least under the laboratory conditions presented. We conclude that the effects reported are most likely to be mediated through the initiation of costly immune responses and/or tissue repair mechanisms. Although we found no evidence of hastened secondary sexual trait regression, through reducing individual body condition and potentially, breeding season duration, we predict that Bd exposure might have negative impacts on populations of palmate newts through reducing individual reproductive success and adult recruitment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheatsazan","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Almedia","given":"Ana P Lugon Gavinho","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Andrew F"},{"family":"Bonneaud","given":"Camille"}],"citation-key":"cheatsazan2013","container-title":"BMC Ecology","DOI":"10.1186/1472-6785-13-27","ISSN":"1472-6785","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Experimental evidence for a cost of resistance to the fungal pathogen, <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>, for the palmate newt, <i>Lissotriton helveticus</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6785-13-27","volume":"13"},

We constructed an individual-­based model to determine the relationships between genetic variation in host susceptibility and population persistence in an amphibian-­fungal pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) system. We found that host populations can rapidly evolve reduced susceptibility to a novel pathogen and that this rapid evolution led to a 71-f­old increase in the likelihood of host–pathogen coexistence. However, the increased rates of coexistence came at a cost to host populations; fewer populations cleared infection, population sizes were depressed, and neutral genetic diversity was lost.

For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2, λ) penalty with λ → 0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case—pure penalization or prior information—our recommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chung","given":"Yeojin"},{"family":"Rabe-Hesketh","given":"Sophia"},{"family":"Dorie","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jingchen"}],"citation-key":"chung2013","container-title":"Psychometrika","container-title-short":"Psychometrika","DOI":"10.1007/s11336-013-9328-2","ISSN":"0033-3123, 1860-0980","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"language":"en","page":"685-709","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A nondegenerate penalized likelihood estimator for variance parameters in multilevel models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11336-013-9328-2","volume":"78"},

The most commonly applied method for the detection of Bd is the use of a sterile swab, rubbed over the keratinized areas of an amphibian and then processed to yield DNA for detection by qPCR. This method has been used to infer a threshold of lethal infection in some species; however, how reliable and reproducible the swabbing method is at detecting the true burden of infection suffered by individuals is not known. European midwife toads, Alytes obstetricans, are susceptible to chytridiomycosis and are highly parasitised by Bd across Europe. By quantifying Bd-load throughout the entire skin and comparing this to swab results taken from the same individual, we determined whether epidermal swabs provide a quantiﬁable and accurate indication of the true fungal burden suffered. Further, we examined whether we could infer a threshold for lethal infection based on comparison of swab data taken from infected A. obstetricans exhibiting different clinical states. From swab data, we detected signiﬁcantly higher fungal burdens from moribund metamorphs compared to visually healthy individuals; however, the ability of these swab data to provide an accurate indication of the true fungal burden was not reliable.

  {"id":"clulow2018","abstract":"Abstract Emerging infectious diseases are one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. Chytridiomycosis in amphibians is perhaps the most extreme example of this phenomenon known to science. Translocations are increasingly used to fight disease-induced extinctions. However, many programmes fail because disease is still present or subsequently establishes in the translocation environment. There is a need for studies in real-world scenarios to test whether environmental manipulation could improve survival in populations by generating unfavourable environmental conditions for pathogens. Reintroductions of amphibians impacted by chytridiomycosis into environments where the disease persists provide a scenario where this paradigm can be tested. We tested the hypothesis that manipulating environmental salinity in outdoor mesocosms under near-identical environmental conditions, present in a nearby translocation programme for an endangered amphibian, would improve survival and determine the mechanisms involved. One hundred and sixty infected and 288 uninfected, captive-bred, juvenile frogs were released into 16 outdoor mesocosms in which salinity was controlled (high- or low-salinity treatment). The experiment was run for 25 weeks from the mid-austral winter to the mid-austral summer of 2013 in a temperate coastal environment, Australia. Increasing salinity from c. 0.5 ppt to 3.5?4.5 ppt reduced pathogen transmission between infected and uninfected animals, resulting in significantly reduced mortality in elevated salt mesocosms (0.13, high-salt vs. 0.23, low-salt survival at 23 weeks). Increasing water temperature associated with season (from mean 13 to 25°C) eventually cleared all surviving animals of the pathogen. Synthesis and applications. We identified a mechanism by which environmental salinity can protect amphibian hosts from chytridomycosis by reducing disease transmission rates. We conclude that manipulating environmental salinity in landscapes where chytrid-affected amphibians are currently translocated could improve the probability of population persistence for hundreds of species. More broadly, we provide support for the paradigm that environmental manipulation can be used to mitigate the impact of emerging infectious diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Clulow","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Gould","given":"John"},{"family":"James","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Clulow","given":"John"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"clulow2018","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.13030","ISSN":"0021-8901","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"page":"830-840","source":"besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au (Atypon)","title":"Elevated salinity blocks pathogen transmission and improves host survival from the global amphibian chytrid pandemic: Implications for translocations","title-short":"Elevated salinity blocks pathogen transmission and improves host survival from the global amphibian chytrid pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13030","volume":"55"},

However, few studies have combined experiments, field data, and historical climate records to provide evidence that an interaction between climate change and disease caused any host declines. A recently proposed hypothesis, the thermal mismatch hypothesis, could identify host species that are vulnerable to disease under climate change because it predicts that cool‐ and warm‐adapted hosts should be vulnerable to disease at unusually warm and cool temperatures, respectively. Here, we conduct experiments on Atelopus zeteki, a critically endangered, captively bred frog that prefers relatively cool temperatures, and show that frogs have high pathogen loads and high mortality rates only when exposed to a combination of the pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and high temperatures, as predicted by the thermal mismatch hypothesis. Further, we tested various hypotheses to explain recent declines experienced by species in the amphibian genus Atelopus that are thought to be associated with B. dendrobatidis and reveal that these declines are best explained by the thermal mismatch hypothesis. As in our experiments, only the combination of rapid increases in temperature and infectious disease could account for the patterns of declines, especially in species adapted to relatively cool environments. After combining experiments on declining hosts with spatiotemporal patterns in the field, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that widespread species declines, including possible extinctions, have been driven by an interaction between increasing temperatures and infectious disease. Moreover, our findings suggest that hosts adapted to relatively cool conditions will be most vulnerable to the combination of increases in mean temperature and emerging infectious diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jeremy M."},{"family":"Civitello","given":"David J."},{"family":"Venesky","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Taegan A."},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."}],"citation-key":"cohen2019","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.14489","ISSN":"13541013","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"language":"en","page":"927-937","source":"Crossref","title":"An interaction between climate change and infectious disease drove widespread amphibian declines","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/gcb.14489","volume":"25"},

Across species, temperature influenced species’ distributions more than precipitation at weekly and monthly scales, while precipitation was more important at seasonal scales. Phylogenetically controlled multivariate models revealed that migration distance was the most important factor mediating responses to extremely hot or dry weeks; residents and short-distance migrants occurred less often following extreme heat. At monthly or seasonal scales, less common birds experienced decreases in occurrence following drought-like conditions, while widespread species were unaffected. Spatial predictions demonstrated variation in responses to extreme weather across species’ ranges, with predicted decreases in occurrence up to 40% in parts of ranges. Our results highlight that extreme weather has variable and potentially strong implications for birds at different time scales, but these responses are mediated by lifehistory characteristics.

  {"id":"colchero2020","abstract":"Today, we know that demographic rates can be greatly influenced by differences among individuals in their capacity to survive and reproduce. These intrinsic differences, commonly known as individual heterogeneity, can rarely be measured and are thus treated as latent variables when modeling mortality. Finite mixture models and mixed effects models have been proposed as alternative approaches for inference on individual heterogeneity in mortality. However, in general models assume that individual heterogeneity influences mortality proportionally, which limits the possibility to test hypotheses on the effect of individual heterogeneity on other aspects of mortality such as ageing rates. Here, we propose a Bayesian model that builds upon the mixture models previously developed, but that facilitates making inferences on the effect of individual heterogeneity on mortality parameters other than the baseline mortality. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the Gompertz–Makeham mortality model, commonly used in human and wildlife studies, by assuming that the Gompertz rate parameter is affected by individual heterogeneity. We provide results of a simulation study where we show that the model appropriately retrieves the parameters used for simulation, even for low variances in the heterogeneous parameter.

  {"id":"colchero2021","abstract":"Theoretical and empirical research has shown that increased variability in demographic rates often results in a decline in the population growth rate. In order to reduce the adverse effects of increased variability, life-history theory predicts that demographic rates that contribute disproportionately to population growth should be buffered against environmental variation. To date, evidence of demographic buffering is still equivocal and limited to analyses on a reduced number of age classes (e.g. juveniles and adults), and on single sex models. Here we used Bayesian inference models for age-specific survival and fecundity on a long-term dataset of wild mountain gorillas. We used these estimates to parameterize two-sex, age-specific stochastic population projection models that accounted for the yearly covariation between demographic rates. We estimated the sensitivity of the long-run stochastic population growth rate to reductions in survival and fecundity on ages belonging to nine sex-age classes for survival and three age classes for female fecundity. We found a statistically significant negative linear relationship between the sensitivities and variances of demographic rates, with strong demographic buffering on young adult female survival and low buffering on older female and silverback survival and female fecundity. We found moderate buffering on all immature stages and on prime-age females. Previous research on long-lived slow species has found high buffering of prime-age female survival and low buffering on immature survival and fecundity. Our results suggest that the moderate buffering of the immature stages can be partially due to the mountain gorilla social system and the relative stability of their environment. Our results provide clear support for the demographic buffering hypothesis and its predicted effects on species at the slow end of the slow–fast life-history continuum, but with the surprising outcome of moderate social buffering on the survival of immature stages. We also demonstrate how increasing the number of sex-age classes can greatly improve the detection of demographic buffering in wild populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Colchero","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Eckardt","given":"Winnie"},{"family":"Stoinski","given":"Tara"}],"citation-key":"colchero2021","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13486","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1701-1713","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evidence of demographic buffering in an endangered great ape: Social buffering on immature survival and the role of refined sex-age classes on population growth rate","title-short":"Evidence of demographic buffering in an endangered great ape","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13486","volume":"90"},

We used drones to obtain high-resolution tracks of 108 white sharks directly off coastal beaches on the east coast of Australia. White sharks ranged from 1.9 to 4.0 m (total length) and typically swam parallel to the beach line at an average speed of 0.82 m s−1 (∼3.0 km h−1), with behavior being characteristic of energy conserving motion and foraging. Notably the presence of schools of ﬁsh increased mean swim speeds of sharks by 0.33 m s−1 and caused tracks to be more convoluted. White sharks were also observed to swim straighter and faster with time either side of midday, increasing predicted mean swim speeds by 0.11 m s−1, and net travel velocities by 0.25 m s−1. White sharks also displayed inquisitive behavior toward various potential food and non-food items. We demonstrate that white sharks display largely predictable track trajectories and slow movement speeds along coastal beaches, which has utility in further developing non-destructive shark mitigation strategies.

Total macroinvertebrate biomass and production ranged from 231 to 360 mg ash-free dry mass m22 and from 3.1 to 4.4 g ash-free dry mass m22 yr21, respectively, and did not appear influenced by the presence or absence of amphibians. However, macroinvertebrate functional structure differed between pre- and post-decline sites, with shredder production significantly higher in pre-decline sites and scrapers significantly higher in post-decline sites. Taxonomic differences between pre- and post-decline sites were also evident. There was a shift in scrapers from smaller-bodied taxa (e.g., Psephenus) in pre-decline sites to larger-bodied groups (e.g., Petrophila) in post-decline sites. Detrital pathways were dominant in these systems, with shredders and collectors accounting for most energy flow. However, scrapers were well-represented and they were food-limited in these systems, particularly in the presence of larval amphibians at pre-decline sites. Ecological effects of catastrophic amphibian declines ranged from subtle shifts in taxonomic composition and functional structure of remaining consumers to changes in the availability and relative importance of autochthonous energy sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Colón-Gaud","given":"Checo"},{"family":"Whiles","given":"Matt R."},{"family":"Kilham","given":"Susan S."},{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."},{"family":"Pringle","given":"Cathy M."},{"family":"Connelly","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Scot D."}],"citation-key":"colon-gaud2009","container-title":"Limnology and Oceanography","DOI":"10.4319/lo.2009.54.1.0331","ISSN":"00243590","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"language":"en","page":"331-343","source":"Crossref","title":"Assessing ecological responses to catastrophic amphibian declines: Patterns of macroinvertebrate production and food web structure in upland Panamanian streams","title-short":"Assessing ecological responses to catastrophic amphibian declines","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.4319/lo.2009.54.1.0331","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"conn2017","abstract":"Population surveys are often used to estimate the density, abundance, or distribution of natural populations. Recently, model-based approaches to analyzing survey data have become popular because one can more readily accommodate departures from pre-planned survey routes and construct more detailed maps than one can with design-based procedures. Spatial models for population distributions (SMPDs) often make the implicit assumption that locations chosen for sampling and animal abundance at those locations are conditionally independent given modelled covariates. However, this assumption may be violated when survey effort is non-randomized, leading to preferential sampling. We develop a hierarchical statistical modelling framework for detecting and alleviating the biasing effects of preferential sampling in spatial distribution models fitted to count data. The approach works by specifying a joint model for population density and the locations selected for sampling, and specifying a dependent correlation structure between the two processes. Using simulation, we show that moderate levels of preferential sampling can lead to large (e.g. 40%) bias in estimates of animal density and that our modelling approach can considerably reduce this bias. In contrast, preferential sampling did not appear to bias inferences about parameters informing species–habitat relationships (i.e. slope parameters). We apply our approach to aerial survey counts of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) in the eastern Bering Sea. As expected, models with a preferential sampling effect led to lower abundance than those without. However, several lines of reasoning (better predictive performance, higher biological realism) led us to prefer models without a preferential sampling effect for this dataset. When population surveys break from traditional scientific survey design principles, ecologists should recognize the potentially biasing effects of preferential sampling when estimating population density or occurrence. Joint models, such as those described in this paper, can be used to test and correct for such biases. However, such models can be unstable; ultimately the best way to avoid preferential sampling bias is to incorporate design-based principles such as randomization and/or systematic sampling into survey design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Conn","given":"Paul B."},{"family":"Thorson","given":"James T."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Devin S."}],"citation-key":"conn2017","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12803","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"1535-1546","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Confronting preferential sampling when analysing population distributions: diagnosis and model-based triage","title-short":"Confronting preferential sampling when analysing population distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12803","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"cook2011","abstract":"A useful technique from the subjective Bayesian viewpoint, is to ask the subject matter researchers and other parties involved, such as pharmaceutical companies and regulatory bodies, for reasonable optimistic and pessimistic priors regarding the eﬀectiveness of a new treatment. Up to now, the proposed skeptical and optimistic priors have been limited to conjugate priors, though there is no need for this limitation. The same reasonably adversarial points of view can take with robust priors. Robust priors permit a much faster and eﬃcient resolution of the disagreement between the conclusions based on skeptical and optimistic priors. As a consequence, robust Bayesian clinical trials tend to be shorter. Our proposal in this paper is to use Cauchy and intrinsic robust priors for both skeptical and optimistic priors leading to results more closely related with the sampling data when prior and data are in conﬂict. In other words, the use of robust priors removes the dogmatism implicit in conjugate priors. Dogmatism here has very precise meaning: Conjugate priors aﬀect the posterior conclusions by a ﬁxed rate, regardless if there is a conﬂict between prior and data. Robust priors are automatically discounted by Bayes Theorem in the presence of conﬂict.","author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"John"},{"family":"Fúquene","given":"Jairo"},{"family":"Pericchi","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"cook2011","container-title":"Revista Colombiana de Estadística","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"333-345","source":"Zotero","title":"Skeptical and optimistic robust priors for clinical trials","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"cruz2016","abstract":"Thermal dependence of the Colombian endemic salamander Bolitoglossa ramosi (Caudata, Plethodontidae). Environmental temperature is a determining factor in the physiological and behavioral processes of amphibians because they are ectotherms and consequently depend on external heat sources to achieve optimal body temperatures. The aim of this study was to determine the thermal dependence of the Colombian endemic salamander Bolitoglossa ramosi Brame & Wake, 1972 with respect to the air and substrate temperatures. Field samples were carried out in the municipality of Líbano, Tolima, Colombia, between 18:00 and 24:00 hours, in April and May 2015. 34 individuals were captured and for each salamander it was recorded: the body temperature, body mass and body length. The substrate and air temperatures were also measured in the place where the animals were found. Body temperature of the individuals had a mean of 18.3±0.55°C, showing a positive and significant relationship to the substrate and air temperatures, which demonstrates that the species is thermoconformer. Furthermore, the body temperature showed a higher thermal dependence on the substrate than the air temperature indicating that B. ramosi presents a tigmothermal regulation. Finally, the body temperature was not related to body length or body mass. This information is useful for understanding the thermal biology of the species and the possible physiological responses to the increase in environmental temperatures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Cruz","given":"Erika X."},{"family":"Galindo","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Bernal","given":"Manuel H."}],"citation-key":"cruz2016","container-title":"Iheringia.

  {"id":"dail2011","abstract":"Using only spatially and temporally replicated point counts, Royle (2004b, Biometrics 60, 108–115) developed an N -mixture model to estimate the abundance of an animal population when individual animal detection probability is unknown. One assumption inherent in this model is that the animal populations at each sampled location are closed with respect to migration, births, and deaths throughout the study. In the past this has been veriﬁed solely by biological arguments related to the study design as no statistical veriﬁcation was available. In this article, we propose a generalization of the N -mixture model that can be used to formally test the closure assumption. Additionally, when applied to an open metapopulation, the generalized model provides estimates of population dynamics parameters and yields abundance estimates that account for imperfect detection probability and do not require the closure assumption. A simulation study shows these abundance estimates are less biased than the abundance estimate obtained from the original N -mixture model. The proposed model is then applied to two data sets of avian point counts. The ﬁrst example demonstrates the closure test on a single-season study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and the second uses the proposed model to estimate the population dynamics parameters and yearly abundance of American robins (Turdus migratorius) from a multi-year study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dail","given":"D."},{"family":"Madsen","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"dail2011","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01465.x","ISSN":"0006341X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]},"language":"en","page":"577-587","source":"Crossref","title":"Models for estimating abundance from repeated counts of an open metapopulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01465.x","volume":"67"},

A re-introduction proposal was prepared for the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) and independently reviewed by two referees, pre-release surveys of frogs were undertaken to determine if L. aurea existed on the site and to ascertain if the pathogen Bactrachochytrium dendrobatiodis (chytrid) was present within the endemic frog population. The captive bred tadpoles were tested for the presence of chytrid prior to release. The water quality was tested at the proposed release site and potential predators were removed.The project required maintenance and breeding of the captive population, and post release surveys. The project took 4.5 years from submission of the proposal to the first release of tadpoles and to date has cost approximately $190K, of which only $37K was funded.

  {"id":"darracq2016","abstract":"A clear understanding of how management inﬂuences vertebrate biodiversity is critical for the conservation of rare ecosystems, such as the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in the southeastern United States. We used scientiﬁc literature to assess how vertebrate use of the longleaf pine ecosystem (High or low) differed in response to high (1–3 years), moderate (>3–5 years), and low (>5 years) burn frequencies. For all species combined, we found that the number of high use (HU) species associated with moderately burned forests (n = 140) was 22% and 33% greater than in high (n = 115) and low burn (n = 105) frequency forests, respectively. This pattern was most clear for Aves and Reptilia. Speciﬁcally, the number of HU species associated with moderate burn frequencies (Aves – n = 69; Reptilia – n = 36) was 21% and 25% greater for Aves and 56 and 63% greater for Reptilia than high (Aves – n = 57; Reptilia – n = 23) and low burn frequencies (Aves – n = 55; Reptilia – n = 22), respectively. We found no difference in the number of HU species across burn frequencies for Amphibia or Mammalia. For species considered longleaf pine specialists, across all vertebrate taxa the number of HU species was associated with areas of high and moderate burn frequencies. We posit that moderate burn frequencies had the greatest number of HU species because of requirements for multiple habitat types, structural diversity, and habitat components that are reduced in, or not provided by, areas with high burn frequencies. If conservation of speciﬁc longleaf pine specialists that rely on habitat created by high ﬁre frequencies (e.g. Red-cockaded woodpeckers) is the objective, we suggest managing with high burn frequencies at the local scale. Conversely, if management objectives include maximizing wildlife diversity, managers should use a more variable ﬁre regime across the landscape, from annual to less frequent 5 year burn intervals, to maintain localized patches of oaks and increase the compositional and structural diversity within the system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Darracq","given":"Andrea K."},{"family":"Boone","given":"Wesley W."},{"family":"McCleery","given":"Robert A."}],"citation-key":"darracq2016","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.039","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]},"language":"en","page":"214-221","source":"Crossref","title":"Burn regime matters: A review of the effects of prescribed fire on vertebrates in the longleaf pine ecosystem","title-short":"Burn regime matters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112716303954","volume":"378"},

In response to increased pressure on habitat in this region by tourism, we used 4 months of radiotelemetry data for 17 adult Common Toads (Bufo bufo) to characterize the terrestrial movements, assess the factors inﬂuencing these movements, and determine the distribution and cover characteristics of summer refugia for these toads. We found that: 1) movements were most pronounced following the breeding season in June, and adults made movements of up to 470 m away from breeding sites, 2) movements were not inﬂuenced by basin size, climatic variables, or the sex of the individual, 3) the amount of terrestrial habitat used by toads ranged from 245 m2 to 2.5 ha, and 4) within these areas toads most often used rock piles and juniper patches (Juniperus communis nana) as cover during the summer.

  {"id":"daversa2018a","abstract":"Risks of parasitism vary over time, with infection prevalence often fluctuating with seasonal changes in the annual cycle. Identifying the biological mechanisms underlying seasonality in infection can enable better prediction and prevention of future infection peaks. Obtaining longitudinal data on individual infections and traits across seasons throughout the annual cycle is perhaps the most effective means of achieving this aim, yet few studies have obtained such information for wildlife. Here, we tracked spiny common toads (Bufo spinosus) within and across annual cycles to assess seasonal variation in movement, body temperatures and infection from the fungal parasite, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Across annual cycles, toads did not consistently sustain infections but instead gained and lost infections from year to year. Radiotracking showed that infected toads lose infections during post-breeding migrations, and no toads contracted infection following migration, which may be one explanation for the inter-annual variability in Bd infections. We also found pronounced seasonal variation in toad body temperatures. Body temperatures approached 0 ◦C during winter hibernation but remained largely within the thermal tolerance range of Bd. These findings provide direct documentation of migratory recovery (i.e., loss of infection during migration) and escape in a wild population. The body temperature reductions that we observed during hibernation warrant further consideration into the role that this period plays in seasonal Bd dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Daversa","given":"David R."},{"family":"Monsalve-Carcaño","given":"Camino"},{"family":"Carrascal","given":"Luis M."},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Jaime"}],"citation-key":"daversa2018a","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4698","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e4698","source":"Crossref","title":"Seasonal migrations, body temperature fluctuations, and infection dynamics in adult amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4698","volume":"6"},

There is currently little understanding of how initial community structure may drive the microbiota trajectory across host development or influence bacterial therapy outcomes. Probiotic baths of surface symbionts, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Flavobacterium johnsoniae were administered to 240 tadpoles of the midwife toad, Alytes obstetricans in semi-natural outdoor mesocosms originating from geographically and genetically distinct populations in Switzerland. Host bacterial and fungal assemblages were compared in tadpoles from the pond of origin, across metamorphosis, and in toadlets via microbial fingerprinting. Bacterial and fungal community structures differed significantly among populations and a microbial population signature persisted from the tadpole stage, through metamorphosis, and following probiotic treatment. A minimal core surface microbiota is described by persistence through development and by shared membership across populations. The impact of F. johnsoniae on the tadpole surface microbiome was assessed with shotgun metagenomics. Bacterial therapy reduced abundance, diversity, and functional repertoire compared to untreated controls. A correlation between host skin peptides and microbiota suggests a mechanism of host-directed symbiosis throughout development. Early developmental stages are ideal targets for amphibian bacterial therapy that can govern a microbiome trajectory at critical timepoints and may impact susceptibility to disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Leyla R."},{"family":"Bigler","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Woodhams","given":"Douglas C."}],"citation-key":"davis2017","container-title":"Environmental Microbiology","DOI":"10.1111/1462-2920.13707","ISSN":"1462-2920","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"1502-1517","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Developmental trajectories of amphibian microbiota: response to bacterial therapy depends on initial community structure","title-short":"Developmental trajectories of amphibian microbiota","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.13707","volume":"19"},

Elasticities thus indicate the relative “importance” of life cycle transitions for population growth and maintenance. In this paper, we discuss the applications of elasticity analysis, and its extension, loop analysis, in life history studies and conservation. Elasticity can be interpreted as the relative contribution of a demographic parameter to population growth rate. Loop analysis reveals the underlying pathway structure of the life cycle graph. The different kinds of results of the two analyses in studies of life histories are emphasized. Because elasticities quantify the relative importance of life cycle transitions to population growth rate, it is generally inferred that management should focus on the transitions with the largest elasticities. Such predictions based on elasticities seem robust, but we do identify three situations where problems may arise. The mathematical properties and biological constraints that underlie these pitfalls are explained. Examples illustrate the additional information that needs to be taken into account for a sensible use of elasticities in population management.

  {"id":"deleon2020","abstract":"A highly virulent genotype of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the Global Panzootic Lineage (Bd-GPL), is implicated as a major cause of global amphibian population declines. Bd-GPL strain JEL274 was originally isolated from the skin of Western Toads (Anaxyrus boreas) in Colorado, USA, where populations are in decline due to chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by Bd. Here, the difficulty in attempting to control BdJEL274 is shown by challenging the genotype against three methods of inhibition: exposure to the antifungal drug amphotericin B, recombinant E. coli-violacein, and A. boreas skin-associated bacterial isolates. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value of amphotericin B on Bd-JEL274 was 10-fold higher than in previously tested strains, suggesting that Bd-JEL274 is remarkably drug-resistant. Violacein, an antifungal secondary metabolite naturally expressed by some proteobacteria, has been shown to inhibit growth of the fungus. In this study, the difference in fungal inhibition between recombinant E. coli-violacein and natural antifungal activities of bacteria isolated from captive A. boreas skin was demonstrated using in vitro Bdbacterium inhibition assays. The abundant skin-associated bacterium Chryseobacterium indologenes inhibited Bd-JEL274 significantly better than recombinant E. coli-violacein and this bacterium may have been involved in the natural clearing of Bd infections in the toads. Larger studies should focus on using the amphibian skin microbiome for probiotic treatment of chytridiomycosis in A. boreas toads, rather than risking lowered fitness or increased mortality from drug treatments.","author":[{"family":"De León","given":"Marina E."}],"citation-key":"deleon2020","container-title":"Amphibian & Reptile Conservation","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"12-23","source":"Zotero","title":"Comparison of <i>in vitro</i> methods to inhibit growth of a virulent strain of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (Longcore, Pessier, and Nichols 1999)","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

However, the mechanistic understanding of hormesis, to date, is extremely limited. Herein is proposed a novel parametric model with a mechanistic basis and two model-based parameters for hormesis that was successfully applied to the hormetic dose−response observed in the chronic toxicity of sulfonamides on Photobacterium phosphoreum. On the basis of the methods of molecular docking and quantitative structure− activity relationships (QSARs), we proposed a mechanistic hypothesis for hormesis that introduces for the ﬁrst time the concept of quorum sensing in toxicological studies and explains the mechanism at the level of the receptors. The mechanistic hypothesis stated that (1) speciﬁc target binding like interaction with LuxR may contribute to transcriptional activation leading to enhanced luciferase activity at low dose exposure of sulfonamides, and (2) as the dose of sulfonamides increases, more sulfonamides competitively bind to dihydropteroate synthase, which inhibit the biosynthesis of folic acid and thus provoke toxicity. This mechanistic hypothesis, which explains both the dosedependent and time-dependent features of hormesis, could give new insight into the mechanistic study of hormesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Deng","given":"Ziqing"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhifen"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Xiaoming"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Zhifeng"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Dayong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dali"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Daqiang"}],"citation-key":"deng2012","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Environ.

We explain and exploit the equivalence of N-mixture and multivariate Poisson and negative-binomial models, which provides powerful new approaches for fitting these models. We show that particularly when detection probability and the number of sampling occasions are small, infinite estimates of abundance can arise. We propose a sample covariance as a diagnostic for this event, and demonstrate its good performance in the Poisson case. Infinite estimates may be missed in practice, due to numerical optimization procedures terminating at arbitrarily large values. It is shown that the use of a bound, K, for an infinite summation in the N-mixture likelihood can result in underestimation of abundance, so that default values of K in computer packages should be avoided. Instead we propose a simple automatic way to choose K.

  {"id":"devalpine2017","abstract":"We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This article provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).

  {"id":"diana2021","abstract":"In recent years, the study of species' occurrence has benefited from the increased availability of large-scale citizen-science data. While abundance data from standardized monitoring schemes are biased toward well-studied taxa and locations, opportunistic data are available for many taxonomic groups, from a large number of locations and across long timescales. Hence, these data provide opportunities to measure species' changes in occurrence, particularly through the use of occupancy models, which account for imperfect detection. These opportunistic datasets can be substantially large, numbering hundreds of thousands of sites, and hence present a challenge from a computational perspective, especially within a Bayesian framework. In this paper, we develop a unifying framework for Bayesian inference in occupancy models that account for both spatial and temporal autocorrelation. We make use of the Pólya-Gamma scheme, which allows for fast inference, and incorporate spatio-temporal random effects using Gaussian processes (GPs), for which we consider two efficient approximations: subset of regressors and nearest neighbor GPs. We apply our model to data on two UK butterfly species, one common and widespread and one rare, using records from the Butterflies for the New Millennium database, producing occupancy indices spanning 45 years. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of taxa, providing measures of variation in species' occurrence, which are used to assess biodiversity change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Diana","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"Emily Beth"},{"family":"Matechou","given":"Eleni"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Byron John Treharne"}],"citation-key":"diana2021","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/biom.13816","ISSN":"1541-0420","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fast Bayesian inference for large occupancy datasets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13816"},

  {"id":"diete2015","abstract":"Critical evaluations of bait attractiveness for camera trapping wildlife are scant even though use of the most attractive bait should improve detection of cryptic, threatened species. We aimed to determine the most attractive bait for camera trapping the northern hopping-mouse (Notomys aquilo) and sympatric mammals. We also tested the effectiveness of overhead camera trap orientation in identifying individual northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) as this could be used to deﬁne a camera trap event for analysis purposes. Using white-ﬂash camera traps, the attractiveness of four baits (peanut butter with oats, corn, sesame oil and sunﬂower kernels) and a control were compared for N. aquilo, D. hallucatus, the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) and the agile wallaby (Notamacropus agilis). Spot patterns of D. hallucatus were compared to determine the visitation rate of individuals. Peanut butter– and sesame oil–based baits were signiﬁcantly more attractive to D. hallucatus, while I. macrourus strongly preferred the peanut butter bait. Bait type did not affect the mean number of events for N. aquilo or N. agilis. The consistently identiﬁable images of individual D. hallucatus were used to determine the optimal event delineator of 15 min. The improved techniques for camera trapping D. hallucatus should be valuable for future capture–recapture studies of this species. Camera trapping is a viable replacement for the ineffective method of indexing the abundance of N. aquilo using indirect signs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Diete","given":"Rebecca L."},{"family":"Meek","given":"Paul D."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Dickman","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Leung","given":"Luke K.-P."}],"citation-key":"diete2015","container-title":"Australian Journal of Zoology","container-title-short":"Aust.

  {"id":"direnzo2017","abstract":"Emerging infectious diseases can cause host community disassembly, but the mechanisms driving the order of species declines and extirpations following a disease outbreak are unclear. We documented the community disassembly of a Neotropical tadpole community during a chytridiomycosis outbreak, triggered by the generalist fungal pathogen, Batra­ chochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Within the first 11 months of Bd arrival, tadpole density and occupancy rapidly declined. Species rarity, in terms of tadpole occupancy and adult relative abundance, did not predict the odds of tadpole occupancy declines. But species losses were taxonomically selective, with glassfrogs (Family: Centrolenidae) disappearing the fastest and tree frogs (Family: Hylidae) and dart-p­ oison frogs (Family: Dendrobatidae) remaining the longest. We detected biotic homogenization of tadpole communities, with post-d­ecline communities resembling one another more strongly than pre-d­ ecline communities. The entire tadpole community was extirpated within 22 months following Bd arrival, and we found limited signs of recovery within 10 years post-o­ utbreak. Because of imperfect species detection inherent to sampling species-r­ich tropical communities and the difficulty of devising a single study design protocol to sample physically complex tropical habitats, we used simulations to provide recommendations for future surveys to adequately sample diverse Neotropical communities. Our unique data set on tadpole community composition before and after Bd arrival is a valuable baseline for assessing amphibian recovery. Our results are of direct relevance to conservation managers and community ecologists interested in understanding the timing, magnitude, and consequences of disease outbreaks as emerging infectious diseases spread globally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"DiRenzo","given":"Graziella V."},{"family":"Che-Castaldo","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Rugenski","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Brenes","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Whiles","given":"Matt R."},{"family":"Pringle","given":"Catherine M."},{"family":"Kilham","given":"Susan S."},{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."}],"citation-key":"direnzo2017","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1443","ISSN":"10510761","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1]]},"language":"en","page":"309-320","source":"Crossref","title":"Disassembly of a tadpole community by a multi-host fungal pathogen with limited evidence of recovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/eap.1443","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"direnzo2018a","abstract":"Emerging infectious pathogens are responsible for some of the most severe host mass mortality events in wild populations. Yet, effective pathogen control strategies are notoriously difficult to identify, in part because quantifying and forecasting pathogen spread and disease dynamics is challenging. Following an outbreak, hosts must cope with the presence of the pathogen, leading to host–pathogen coexistence or extirpation. Despite decades of research, little is known about host–pathogen coexistence post-outbreak when low host abundances and cryptic species make these interactions difficult to study. Using a novel disease-structured N-mixture model, we evaluate empirical support for three host–pathogen coexistence hypotheses (source–sink, eco-evolutionary rescue, and spatial variation in pathogen transmission) in a Neotropical amphibian community decimated by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in 2004. During 2010–2014, we surveyed amphibians in Parque Nacional G. D. Omar Torr ıjos Herrera, Cocl e Province, El Cop e, Panama. We found that the primary driver of host–pathogen coexistence was eco-evolutionary rescue, as evidenced by similar amphibian survival and recruitment rates between infected and uninfected hosts. Average apparent monthly survival rates of uninfected and infected hosts were both close to 96%, and the expected number of uninfected and infected hosts recruited (via immigration/reproduction) was less than one host per disease state per 20-m site. The secondary driver of host–pathogen coexistence was spatial variation in pathogen transmission as we found that transmission was highest in areas of low abundance but there was no support for the source–sink hypothesis. Our results indicate that changes in the host community (i.e., through genetic or species composition) can reduce the impacts of emerging infectious disease post-outbreak. Our disease-structured N-mixture model represents a valuable advancement for conservation managers trying to understand underlying host–pathogen interactions and provides new opportunities to study disease dynamics in remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"DiRenzo","given":"Graziella V."},{"family":"Zipkin","given":"Elise F."},{"family":"Grant","given":"Evan H.

  {"id":"direnzo2019","abstract":"Obtaining inferences on disease dynamics (e.g., host population size, pathogen prevalence, transmission rate, host survival probability) typically requires marking and tracking individuals over time. While multistate mark–recapture models can produce high‐quality inference, these techniques are difficult to employ at large spatial and long temporal scales or in small remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens, where low recapture rates may preclude the use of mark–recapture techniques. Recently developed N‐mixture models offer a statistical framework for estimating wildlife disease dynamics from count data. N‐mixture models are a type of state‐space model in which observation error is attributed to failing to detect some individuals when they are present (i.e., false negatives). The analysis approach uses repeated surveys of sites over a period of population closure to estimate detection probability. We review the challenges of modeling disease dynamics and describe how N‐mixture models can be used to estimate common metrics, including pathogen prevalence, transmission, and recovery rates while accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection. We also offer a perspective on future research directions at the intersection of quantitative and disease ecology, including the estimation of false positives in pathogen presence, spatially explicit disease‐structured N‐mixture models, and the integration of other data types with count data to inform disease dynamics. Managers rely on accurate and precise estimates of disease dynamics to develop strategies to mitigate pathogen impacts on host populations. At a time when pathogens pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, statistical methods that lead to robust inferences on host populations are critically needed for rapid, rather than incremental, assessments of the impacts of emerging infectious diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"DiRenzo","given":"Graziella V."},{"family":"Che‐Castaldo","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Sarah P."},{"family":"Campbell Grant","given":"Evan H."},{"family":"Zipkin","given":"Elise F."}],"citation-key":"direnzo2019","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.4849","ISSN":"2045-7758, 2045-7758","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","page":"899-909","source":"Crossref","title":"Disease‐structured <i>N</i>‐mixture models: A practical guide to model disease dynamics using count data","title-short":"Disease‐structured <i>N</i> ‐mixture models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.4849","volume":"9"},

However, these models, especially stochastic matrix models, are based upon a multitude of parameters that must usually be estimated with only a few years of data and limited sample sizes within each year, calling into question the accuracy of the results of these models. We ﬁrst discuss how these data limitations create sampling uncertainty and bias in the estimated parameters for a stochastic demography model. Next, we ask whether limited data can favor the construction of deterministic models that ignore variation and correlation of rates. With less than ﬁve years of data, the mean squared error of deterministic models will sometimes be smaller than that of stochastic models, favoring the use of simple models, even when their predictions are known to be biased. Finally, we introduce a procedure to estimate the sampling variation around population growth rate estimates made from demographic models that are based on speciﬁed sampling durations and intensities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Doak","given":"Daniel F."},{"family":"Gross","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Morris","given":"William F."}],"citation-key":"doak2005a","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/04-0611","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",5]]},"language":"en","page":"1154-1163","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding and predicting the effects of sparse data on demographic analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/04-0611","volume":"86"},

  {"id":"douglas2020","abstract":"While a number of amphibian skin microbiomes have been characterized, it is unclear how these communities might vary in response to seasonal changes in the environment and the corresponding behaviors that many amphibians exhibit. Given recent studies demonstrating the importance of the skin microbiome in frog innate immune defense against pathogens, investigating how changes in the environment impact the microbial species present will provide a better understanding of conditions that may alter host susceptibility to pathogens in their environment. We sampled the bacterial skin microbiome of North American wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) from two breeding ponds in the spring, along with the bacterial community present in their vernal breeding pools, and frogs from the nearby forest floor in the summer and fall to determine whether community composition differs by sex, vernal pond site, or temporally across season (spring, summer, fall). Taxon relative abundance data reveals a profile of bacterial phyla similar to those previously described on anuran skin, with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria dominating the wood frog skin microbiome. Our results indicate that sex had no significant effect on skin microbiota diversity; however, this may be due to our limited female frog sample size. Vernal pool site had a small but significant effect on skin microbiota, but skinassociated communities were more similar to each other than to the communities observed in the frogs’ respective pond water. Across seasons, diversity analyses suggest that there are significant differences between the bacterial skin microbiome of frogs from spring and summer/fall groups while the average α-diversity per frog remained consistent. These results illustrate seasonal variation in wood frog skin microbiome structure and highlight the importance of considering temporal trends in an amphibian microbiome, particularly for species whose life history requires recurrent shifts in habitat and behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"Alexander J."},{"family":"Hug","given":"Laura A."},{"family":"Katzenback","given":"Barbara A."}],"citation-key":"douglas2020","container-title":"Microbial Ecology","DOI":"10.1007/s00248-020-01550-5","ISSN":"0095-3628, 1432-184X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Composition of the North American wood frog (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>) bacterial skin microbiome and seasonal variation in community structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00248-020-01550-5"},

The immediate impact ofthe fire on G. lutea adults, and the survival of G. Ititea eggs and larvae after the fire, were also addressed. We found that fuel-reduction burning in spring was associated with a significant decline in the number of calling males. The populations had not recovered two years after the fire. Up to 29% ofthe calling males may have been killed in the fire. Egg and larval survival was not significantly different between treatments. However, the treatments did differ in the cause of death, with higher in-situ egg death and lower predation at burned sites. The short-term impact of spring fuel-reduction burns may pose a serious threat of extinction for very small populations. The endangered species Geocrinia alba has many small, isolated populations and frequent fire may therefore be inimical to their survival. However, we do not know if there is a long-term effect.

  {"id":"driscoll2010","abstract":"Knowing how species respond to ﬁre regimes is essential for ecologically sustainable management. This axiom raises two important questions: (1) what knowledge is the most important to develop and (2) to what extent can current research methods deliver that knowledge? We identify three areas of required knowledge: (i) a mechanistic understanding of species’ responses to ﬁre regimes; (ii) knowledge of how the spatial and temporal arrangement of ﬁres inﬂuences the biota; and (iii) an understanding of interactions of ﬁre regimes with other processes. We review the capacity of empirical research to address these knowledge gaps, and reveal many limitations. Manipulative experiments are limited by the number and scope of treatments that can be applied, natural experiments are limited by treatment availability and confounding factors, and longitudinal studies are difﬁcult to maintain, particularly due to unplanned disturbance events. Simulation modelling is limited by the quality of the underlying empirical data and by uncertainty in how well model structure represents reality. Due to the constraints on large-scale, longterm research, the potential for management experiments to inform adaptive management is limited.

  {"id":"duarte2014","abstract":"The Houston toad Bufo (Anaxyrus) houstonensis is a federally endangered amphibian endemic to east central Texas and is primarily found in the Lost Pines ecoregion. In 2010, we became cautiously optimistic regarding the recovery of the species on the Griffith League Ranch, one of the toad’s primary recovery sites, after an unusually successful reproductive season. Subsequently, the extreme drought throughout Texas deepened, culminating in the fall 2011 high-severity wildfires throughout the Lost Pines ecoregion. After the drought and wildfires, we continued to intensively monitor Houston toads via anuran call surveys, drift fence arrays, and visual observations of reproduction. Our objective was to investigate the dynamics of the Houston toad population on the Griffith League Ranch during these dramatic impacts to its habitat and to discuss the potential for Houston toad recovery in the ecoregion. In summary, both a simulation model and our field monitoring data suggest the Houston toad population on the Griffith League Ranch is at critically low numbers and may be extirpated in the near future if human-mediated recovery strategies are not continued and refined. We do not discern any evidence to suggest the 2011 wildfires have had any direct detrimental impacts on subsequent Houston toad population dynamics. Still, high-resolution data will be needed in the future to quantify how the wildfires affected Houston toad viability over the medium and long term.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Duarte","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Donald J."},{"family":"Forstner","given":"Michael R.J."}],"citation-key":"duarte2014","container-title":"Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management","DOI":"10.3996/112013-JFWM-071","ISSN":"1944-687X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12]]},"language":"en","page":"363-371","source":"Crossref","title":"Documenting extinction in real time: decline of the Houston toad on a primary recovery site","title-short":"Documenting extinction in real time","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/abs/10.3996/112013-JFWM-071","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"duarte2017","abstract":"Managers are increasingly implementing reintroduction programs as part of a global effort to alleviate amphibian declines. Given uncertainty in factors affecting populations and a need to make recurring decisions to achieve objectives, adaptive management is a useful component of these efforts. A major impediment to the estimation of demographic rates often used to parameterize and refine decision-support models is that life-stage-specific monitoring data are frequently sparse for amphibians. We developed a new parameterization for integrated population models to match the ecology of amphibians and capitalize on relatively inexpensive monitoring data to document amphibian reintroductions. We evaluate the capability of this model by fitting it to Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa) monitoring data collected from 2007 to 2014 following their reintroduction within the Klamath Basin, Oregon, USA. The number of egg masses encountered and the estimated adult and metamorph abundances generally increased following reintroduction. We found that survival probability from egg to metamorph ranged from 0.01 in 2008 to 0.09 in 2009 and was not related to minimum spring temperatures, metamorph survival probability ranged from 0.13 in 2010–2011 to 0.86 in 2012–2013 and was positively related to mean monthly temperatures (logit-scale slope = 2.37), adult survival probability was lower for founders (0.40) than individuals recruited after reintroduction (0.56), and the mean number of egg masses per adult female was 0.74. Our study is the first to test hypotheses concerning Oregon spotted frog egg-to-metamorph and metamorph-to-adult transition probabilities in the wild and document their response at multiple life stages following reintroduction. Furthermore, we provide an example to illustrate how the structure of our integrated population model serves as a useful foundation for amphibian decision-support models within adaptive management programs. The integration of multiple, but related, data sets has an advantage of being able to estimate complex ecological relationships across multiple life stages, offering a modeling framework that accommodates uncertainty, enforces parsimony, and ensures all model parameters can be confronted with monitoring data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Duarte","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Pearl","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"James T."}],"citation-key":"duarte2017","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1564","ISSN":"10510761","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1761-1775","source":"Crossref","title":"A new parameterization for integrated population models to document amphibian reintroductions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/eap.1564","volume":"27"},

The analyses reveal considerable variation in plasticity rates of this trait among species, with half-times (how long it takes for the initial deviation from the acclimated phenotype to be reduced by 50% when individuals are shifted to a new environment) ranging from 3.7 to 770.2 h. Furthermore, rates differ among higher taxa, being higher for amphibians and reptiles than for crustaceans and fishes, and with insects being intermediate.

Individual identification is useful for answering a variety of biological questions about animal life histories.

Photo-identification consists in the identification of specimens based on photographic records of unique color-design patterns. This technique has been used with success in several amphibian species. Melanophryniscus montevidensis is an endangered anuran species inhabiting the Uruguayan Atlantic coast. The general pattern of coloration is black with red and yellow blotches on the belly. In this study, we validated the technique of photo-identification assisted by software for individual recognition in M. montevidensis using natural markings. Field trips were performed over 16 months during which, the ventral color pattern of specimens was photographed. The photos were edited and analyzed with the Wild-ID 1.0 software for photographic reconnaissance. An efficiency of 100% was obtained in the visual recognition and 90% in the detection of recaptures using the software. The use of photo-identification using natural marks is an effective technique in this species, because the color pattern of the belly was highly variable among individuals and remained unchanged in individuals over the 16 month period. In this evaluation the use of software for photo-identification was necessary for the treatment of large databases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Elgue","given":"Ernesto"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Gisela"},{"family":"Achaval-Coppes","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Maneyro","given":"Raúl"}],"citation-key":"elgue2014","container-title":"Phyllomedusa","DOI":"10.11606/issn.2316-9079.v13i1p59-66","ISSN":"2316-9079, 1519-1397","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,30]]},"language":"en","page":"59-66","source":"Crossref","title":"Validity of photo-identification technique to analyze natural markings in <i>Melanophryniscus montevidensis</i> (Anura: Bufonidae)","title-short":"Validade da técnica de foto-identificação para analisar marcas naturais em Melanophryniscus montevidensis (Anura","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.revistas.usp.br/phyllo/article/view/84298","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"emmet2021","abstract":"Occupancy-based methods are commonly used to model the distribution, habitat use, and relative abundance of species. In particular, occupancy-based methods are often recommended for monitoring species, allowing researchers to track population trends using detection–non-detection data alone. Occupancy models, however, have proven difficult to apply to rare, highly mobile species. Species’ movements outside of sampling areas may lead to violation of the geographic closure assumption of occupancy models and overestimated occupancy probability. Low detection probability may further inflate occupancy probability estimates. We developed a novel continuous-time, multi-scale occupancy model to simultaneously account for closure assumption violations and low detection probability. We used a simulation study to test our model relative to a discrete-time multi-scale model, and we conducted a power analysis to assess the ability of an instantaneous occupancy parameter to detect trends in abundance, relative to standard occupancy alone. The continuous-time model was competitive with the discrete-time model and was generally computationally faster than and outperformed the discrete-time model when detection probability was low. The instantaneous occupancy parameter outperformed occupancy in terms of power to detect trends when we used an implicit (i.e., estimating occupancy independently in each primary occasion) dynamic occupancy model, but performed no better when we used an explicit (i.e., estimating colonization and extinction) dynamic occupancy model. We applied both discrete-time and continuous-time multi-scale occupancy models to a case study of data collected on wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Washington, USA. We found improved precision in estimates with the continuous-time model and that asymptotic occupancy of wolverines was high, but short-term use of any given area was low. Our multi-scale, continuous-time occupancy model can be used to detect trends in abundance of rare, highly mobile species, regardless of how occupancy dynamics are modeled. Furthermore, our model can allow for more efficient data collection and analysis than traditional discrete-time or spatially multi-scale approaches, as our model uses all available detections and requires only one detector per sampling unit by substituting time for space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Emmet","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Long","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Beth"}],"citation-key":"emmet2021","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.3637","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e03637","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Modeling multi-scale occupancy for monitoring rare and highly mobile species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.3637","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"engbrecht2012","abstract":"Amphibians are threatened globally and, with the increased emphasis on using prescribed fire as an important tool to manage ecosystems, it is essential to understand how amphibians respond when exposed to habitats managed by fire. Most studies have focused on survivorship and population-level effects; how survivors react to postburn landscapes has received less attention. Crawfish frogs (Lithobates areolatus Baird and Girard) are an obligate crayfish burrow-dwelling North American grassland species in steep decline. Individuals spend their nonbreeding season associated with a single crayfish-built burrow, which protects them from dangers, including fire. We compared activity patterns and behaviors of crawfish frogs occupying vegetated and postburned prairie grassland habitats. In total, 24 581 images representing six weeks of observations on eight crawfish frogs (four each in vegetated and postburn habitats) were analyzed. While the number of individuals followed was small, our dataset demonstrated interesting differences in activity patterns and behaviors. In particular, while frogs occupying postburn and vegetated habitats exhibited similar nocturnal behaviors, diurnal behaviors were different. In daylight, crawfish frogs in vegetated habitats spent more time on their feeding platform away from their burrow entrance, while frogs in postburn areas spent most of their time at or in their burrow entrance. Further, frogs in postburn areas first emerged later in the day than frogs in vegetated areas. We conclude that while crawfish frog adults occupying a postburn landscape exhibit different behaviors compared to animals in vegetation, prescribed burns have little effect on adult crawfish frog survivorship and few indirect effects on fitness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Engbrecht","given":"Nathan J."},{"family":"Lannoo","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"engbrecht2012","container-title":"Fire Ecology","DOI":"10.4996/fireecology.0801063","ISSN":"1933-9747","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4]]},"language":"en","page":"63-76","source":"Crossref","title":"Crawfish frog behavioral differences in postburned and vegetated grasslands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.4996/fireecology.0801063","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"enriquez-urzelai2019","abstract":"Current climate warming has already contributed to local extinctions. Amphibians are one of the most sensitive animal groups to climate change, currently undergoing a global decline. Predictive models for Europe and Iberian Peninsula forecast that the future impact of climate change on amphibians will depend on their capacity to alter their distributions by tracking climate warming. In the present study, we explore the responses of Iberian amphibian species to recent climate change, by comparing amphibian distributions between two time periods (1901–1990 vs. 2000–2015). Our findings suggest that, although climatic conditions have changed between the two periods, Iberian amphibians have barely shifted their distribution ranges northwards, with the exception of the southernmost species (Alytes dickhilleni). However, most Iberian amphibians appear to have moved their elevational limits upwards in mountains. Approximately half of the species showed different occupied niches between the two time periods, suggesting that many Iberian amphibians have not been able to reach all the new location with optimal climatic conditions for them. Furthermore, disappearing cold climatic conditions (e.g. those found at mountain tops) limit the potential distribution of cold-adapted species, including European widespread species with their southern margin in the Iberian Peninsula, and endemic species. The combination of a limited ability to shift their ranges and profound climatic changes could pose a challenge to the long-term persistence of Iberian amphibian populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Enriquez-Urzelai","given":"Urtzi"},{"family":"Bernardo","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Moreno-Rueda","given":"Gregorio"},{"family":"Montori","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Llorente","given":"Gustavo"}],"citation-key":"enriquez-urzelai2019","container-title":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-019-02422-9","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","page":"289-301","source":"Crossref","title":"Are amphibians tracking their climatic niches in response to climate warming?

  {"id":"familiarlopez2017","abstract":"In animals and plants, symbiotic bacteria can play an important role in disease resistance of host and are the focus of much current research. Globally, amphibian population declines and extinctions have occurred due to chytridiomycosis, a skin disease caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Currently amphibian skin bacteria are increasingly recognized as important symbiont communities with a relevant role in the defense against pathogens, as some bacteria can inhibit the growth of B. dendrobatidis. This study aims to document the B. dendrobatidis infection status of wild populations of a terrestrial cryptic frog (Philoria loveridgei), and to determine whether infection status is correlated with changes in the skin microbial communities. Skin samples of P. loveridgei were collected along an altitudinal range within the species distribution in subtropical rainforests in southeast Australia. Sampling was conducted in two years during two breeding seasons with the ﬁrst classiﬁed as a “La Niña” year. We used Taqman real-time PCR to determine B. dendrobatidis infection status and 16S amplicon sequencing techniques to describe the skin community structure. We found B. dendrobatidis-positive frogs only in the second sampling year with low infection intensities, and no correlation between B. dendrobatidis infection status and altitude, frog sex or size. Skin bacterial diversity was signiﬁcantly higher in P. loveridgei frogs sampled in the 1st year than in the 2nd year. In addition, 7.4% of the total OTUs were signiﬁcantly more abundant in the 1st year compared to the 2nd year. We identiﬁed 67 bacterial OTUs with a signiﬁcant positive correlation between infection intensity and an OTU’s relative abundance. Forty-ﬁve percent of these OTUs belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, temporal variation was strongly associated with changes in B. dendrobatidis infection status and bacterial community structure of wild populations of P. loveridgei.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Familiar López","given":"Mariel"},{"family":"Rebollar","given":"Eria A."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Reid N."},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"familiarlopez2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2017.02535","ISSN":"1664-302X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,22]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Temporal variation of the skin bacterial community and <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection in the terrestrial cryptic frog <i>Philoria loveridgei</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02535/full","volume":"8"},

The term Bogert effect refers to behavioral compensation entailing microhabitat selection to maintain performance across a gradient of environmental conditions resulting in evolutionary inertia of physiological traits. Here, we compare microhabitats used by plethodontid salamanders distributed along an elevational gradient to determine whether there is behavioral compensation that buffers them from deleterious temperatures and moisture levels. Overall, salamanders preferred cooler and more mesic environments and occupied microhabitats that maintained constant moisture conditions at both high‐ and low‐elevation sites. Our results suggest that salamanders use microhabitats to regulate temperature and moisture levels, which is consistent with the Bogert effect. Maintenance of more moist conditions may help buffer these species from rising temperatures but only in suitable high‐elevation environments that are likely to disappear over the next century. We conclude that behavioral regulation of temperature and moisture is a potential mechanism for the Bogert effect in plethodontid salamanders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Farallo","given":"Vincent R."},{"family":"Wier","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Miles","given":"Donald B."}],"citation-key":"farallo2018","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.4590","ISSN":"20457758","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"11522-11532","source":"Crossref","title":"The Bogert effect revisited: Salamander regulatory behaviors are differently constrained by time and space","title-short":"The Bogert effect revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.4590","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"farquhar2023","abstract":"Effective conservation planning is often predicated on detailed and current information about a species' geographical distribution. However, traditional sources of occurrence data (e.g., online biodiversity databases) may be insufficient for estimating the range of rare, poorly understood species that are readily misidentified. Here, we demonstrate a more holistic approach to this problem, using the poorly known glossy grass skink (Pseudemoia rawlinsoni) as a case study. We first compared the relative contribution made (to our geographical knowledge of the species) by online database records, with that of photo-substantiated records obtained via personal communication (PC). We used ecological niche modelling (ENM) to predict the species' distribution, then performed field surveys at both historical and predicted suitable sites to further clarify its occurrence. 20% of all known records came from the PC method, which resulted in 35 new sites and increased the species' area of occupancy (AOO) by 176 km2. Most records obtained via PC came from the past decade, demonstrating that this method is more effective at elucidating the current distribution. ENM revealed that P. rawlinsoni has a disjunct range, and is mostly a low-elevation coastal species, with the exception of suitable habitat in parts of the high-elevation Australian Alps bioregion. The species' AOO has likely declined over recent decades owing to anthropogenic disturbance, given that 38% of the species' predicted range is now cleared agricultural land, and our field surveys failed to detect the species at 52% of historical record sites. Together, these findings provide a robust foundation of geographical knowledge on which to develop strategic conservation actions for the species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Farquhar","given":"J.

  {"id":"farquhar2023a","abstract":"For most species, the factors that determine geographical range limits are unknown. In mesic-adapted species, populations occurring near the edge of the species’ distribution provide ideal study systems in which to investigate what limits distributional ranges. We aimed to identify the abiotic constraints that preclude an east-Australian mesic adapted lizard (Lampropholis delicata) from occupying arid environments. We performed lizard surveys at sites spanning an elevation/aridity gradient (380–1070 m), and measured the prevalence of habitat features (logs, rocks, leaf litter, bare ground, solar radiation) in addition to hourly temperatures in a variety of microhabitats available to lizards. Species distribution modelling (SDM) was used to identify the macroclimatic variables limiting the species’ distribution. At its inland range limit, L. delicata is associated with mesic high-elevation forests with complex microhabitat structures, which gradually decline in availability towards lower (and more arid) elevations where the species is absent. Moreover, L. delicata is absent from sites with a shallow leaf litter layer, in which daily temperatures exceed the species’ thermal preference range, which we determined in a laboratory thermal gradient. In regards to macroclimate, SDM revealed that temperature seasonality is the primary variable predicting the species’ distribution, suggesting that L. delicata avoids inland areas owing to their high annual thermal variability. By combining multiple lines of evidence, this research highlights that habitat and microclimate suitability—not solely macroclimate suitability—are important range-limiting factors for mesic ectotherms, and should be incorporated in studies addressing range-limiting hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Farquhar","given":"Jules E"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Wyn"},{"family":"Chapple","given":"David G"}],"citation-key":"farquhar2023a","container-title":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","DOI":"10.1093/icb/icad124","ISSN":"1540-7063","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"page":"icad124","source":"Silverchair","title":"Identifying the abiotic factors that determine the inland range limits of a mesic-adapted lizard species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icad124"},
  {"id":"farrer2011","abstract":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a globally ubiquitous fungal infection that has emerged to become a primary driver of amphibian biodiversity loss. Despite widespread effort to understand the emergence of this panzootic, the origins of the infection, its patterns of global spread, and principle mode of evolution remain largely unknown. Using comparative population genomics, we discovered three deeply diverged lineages of Bd associated with amphibians. Two of these lineages were found in multiple continents and are associated with known introductions by the amphibian trade. We found that isolates belonging to one clade, the global panzootic lineage (BdGPL) have emerged across at least five continents during the 20th century and are associated with the onset of epizootics in North America, Central America, the Caribbean, Australia, and Europe. The two newly identified divergent lineages, Cape lineage (BdCAPE) and Swiss lineage (BdCH), were found to differ in morphological traits when compared against one another and BdGPL, and we show that BdGPL is hypervirulent. BdGPL uniquely bears the hallmarks of genomic recombination, manifested as extensive intergenomic phylogenetic conflict and patchily distributed heterozygosity. We postulate that contact between previously genetically isolated allopatric populations of Bd may have allowed recombination to occur, resulting in the generation, spread, and invasion of the hypervirulent BdGPL leading to contemporary disease-driven losses in amphibian biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Farrer","given":"Rhys A."},{"family":"Weinert","given":"Lucy A."},{"family":"Bielby","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Garner","given":"Trenton W.

  {"id":"feder1982","abstract":"In a substrate thermal gradient in the laboratory, seven species of neotropical plethodontid salamanders exhibited distinct thermal preferences. The mean substrate temperature selected in the gradient (preferred body temperature, PBT) was affected by acclimation temperature and feeding in some species, and was negatively correlated with the elevation at which each species was collected. Regulation of the PBT was imprecise and only partially compensated for changes, in environmental temperatures. Even though tropical plethodontids are capable of thermoregulation, they may be unable to thermoregulate in the field because of limited thermal diversity in their microhabitats. Temperatures within typical salamander microhabitats such as bromeliads (Tillandsia sp.) and banana plants (Musa sp.) ranged only 2@? and 3.7@?C, respectively. Diverse temperatures were available nearly in each case, but would have involved exposure to direct light or dehydrating conditions. Water relations may limit thermoregulation in salamanders because hydric requirements restrict salamanders to moist microhabitats, which may have limited thermal diversity. However, in atypical field situations in which moist thermal gradients are available, some terrestrial salamanders (e.g., Thorius narisovalis) are capable of regulating their body temperatures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,5]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Feder","given":"Martin E."}],"citation-key":"feder1982","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1940108","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982"]]},"page":"1665-1674","source":"JSTOR","title":"Thermal ecology of neotropical lungless salamanders (Amphibia: Plethodontidae): environmental temperatures and behavioral responses","title-short":"Thermal ecology of neotropical lungless salamanders (amphibia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1940108","volume":"63"},

We encourage the ecological niche modelling community, as well as journal reviewers and editors, to utilize and further develop this framework to facilitate and improve the reproducibility of future work.

To understand disease persistence within these communities, it is essential to know the contribution each host species makes to parasite transmission and maintenance. However, quantifying those contributions is challenging. We present a conceptual framework for classifying multihost sharing, based on key thresholds for parasite persistence. We then develop a generalized technique to quantify each species’ contribution to parasite persistence, allowing natural systems to be located within the framework. We illustrate this approach using data on gastrointestinal parasites circulating within rodent communities and show that, although many parasites infect several host species, parasite persistence is often driven by just one host species. In some cases, however, parasites require multiple host species for maintenance. Our approach provides a quantitative method for differentiating these cases using minimal reliance on system-speciﬁc parameters, enabling informed decisions about parasite management within poorly understood multihost communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenton","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Streicker","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Petchey","given":"Owen L."},{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Amy B."}],"citation-key":"fenton2015","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/683173","ISSN":"0003-0147, 1537-5323","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","page":"610-622","source":"Crossref","title":"Are all hosts created equal?

  {"id":"fernandez-loras2019","abstract":"Climate change and infectious disease by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are major drivers of amphibian extinctions, but the potential interactions of these two factors are not fully understood. Temperature is known to influence (1) the infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence of Bd; (2) host-parasite dynamics, especially when both hosts and parasites are ectothermic organisms exhibiting thermal sensitivities that may or may not differ; and (3) amphibian vulnerability to extinction depending on their heat tolerance, which may decrease with infection. Thus, in a global warming scenario, with rising temperatures and more frequent and extreme weather events, amphibians infected by Bd could be expected to be more vulnerable if temperatures approach their critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, it is also possible that predicted high temperatures could clear the Bd infection, thus enhancing amphibian survival. We tested these hypotheses by measuring CTmax values of Bd-infected and Bd-free aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial toadlets/juveniles of the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) and examining whether exposure of A. obstetricans individuals to peak temperatures reaching their CTmax clears them from Bd infection. We show that (1) Bd has a wide thermal tolerance range; (2) Bd is capable of altering the thermal physiology of A. obstetricans, which is stage-dependent, lowering CTmax in tadpoles but not in toadlets; and (3) Bd infection is not cleared after exposure of tadpoles or toadlets to CTmax.

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable.

Radiotelemetric monitoring of 16 individuals at Whian Whian State Forest in north-eastern New South Wales over 25 months provided the ﬁrst data on spatial ecology of this threatened taxon. Two major inﬂuences on movements by Stephens’ Banded Snakes were identiﬁed: the distribution of large hollow-bearing trees, and the avoidance of conspeciﬁcs. Radiotracked snakes were sedentary inside tree hollows for extended periods (mean = 8 days) during their active season, interrupted by occasional long (mean = 124 m) nocturnal movements to another shelter tree. Snakes travelled on the ground rather than within the canopy, and thus were potentially exposed to terrestrial predators. Although the home ranges of the radiotracked snakes overlapped substantially (mean = 27%), simultaneous occupancy of ‘shared’ shelter trees was less common than expected by chance. Hence, we conclude that adult Stephens’ Banded Snakes generally avoid the presence of conspeciﬁcs. Snakes used from ﬁve to 30 shelter trees and home ranges of male snakes were larger than those of females (mean = 20.2 vs 5.4 ha). The large spatial scale of these movements, and limited overlap among individuals, means that a viable population of this taxon requires a large area of contiguous forest. This requirement may explain why the species has not persisted in small forest fragments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fitzgerald","given":"M."},{"family":"Shine","given":"R."},{"family":"Lemckert","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"fitzgerald2002","container-title":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01214.x","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10]]},"language":"en","page":"537-545","source":"Crossref","title":"Spatial ecology of arboreal snakes (<i>Hoplocephalus stephensii</i>, Elapidae) in an eastern Australian forest","title-short":"Spatial ecology of arboreal snakes (Hoplocephalus stephensii, Elapidae) in an eastern Australian forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01214.x","volume":"27"},

However, interobserver variation in the detection and correct identiﬁcation of low-density populations of invasive species remains largely unexplored. In this study, we compare the abilities of volunteer and experienced individuals to detect low-density populations of an actively spreading invasive species, and we explore how interobserver variation can bias estimates of the proportion of sites infested derived from occupancy models that allow for both false negative and false positive (misclassiﬁcation) errors. We found that experienced individuals detected small infestations at sites where volunteers failed to ﬁnd infestations. However, occupancy models erroneously suggested that experienced observers had a higher probability of falsely detecting the species as present than did volunteers. This unexpected ﬁnding is an artifact of the modeling framework and results from a failure of volunteers to detect low-density infestations rather than from false positive errors by experienced observers.

We detected abundant Bd-inhibitory skin bacteria across life stages and Bd-inhibitory defense peptides post-metamorphosis in both species. Bd-inhibitory bacteria were proportionally more abundant in adults of both species than in earlier developmental stages. We tested for activity of peptides against the skin microbiota and found that in general peptides did not negatively affect bacterial growth and in some instances facilitated growth.

Treatments were burn plots on upper slopes or lower slopes fenced to prevent white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory or control plots that were unfenced and unburned. Most of the 7 species we observed were the mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ocropheaus), red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and slimy salamander (Plethodon glutinosis). Signiﬁcant population responses were difﬁcult to interpret with numerous treatment and year interactions. Results largely were equivocal. We found no change in woodland salamander assemblage prior to burning or afterwards. There were few differences in adult to juvenile ratios of salamanders among treatments. Still, a priori contrasts of mountain dusky salamanders and red-backed salamander counts corrected for detection probability were greater under coverboards in the 2 years monitored after both prescribed ﬁres had occurred than before burning or in unburned controls. This suggests that these species responded to the reduced leaf litter on the forest ﬂoor by utilizing coverboards more. Similarly, the three predominate species of salamanders also were more numerous under coverboards in plots subjected to deer herbivory with less subsequent forest ﬂoor vegetation as compared to those burned plots that were fenced. Our observations would suggest that woodland salamanders somewhat are tolerant of two prescribed ﬁres within close temporal proximity. However, because woodland salamanders can be signiﬁcantly reduced following timber harvest, continued research is needed to fully understand impacts of ﬁre as a pre-harvest management tool in central Appalachian forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ford","given":"W.

Previous studies indicated that Bd prevalence correlates with cooler temperatures in the field, and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that Bd ceases growth at temperatures above 28uC. Here we investigate how small-scale variations in water temperature correlate with Bd prevalence in the wild. We sampled 221 amphibians, including 201 lowland leopard frogs (Rana [Lithobates] yavapaiensis), from 12 sites in Arizona, USA, and tested them for Bd. Amphibians were encountered in microhabitats that exhibited a wide range of water temperatures (10–50uC), including several geothermal water sources. There was a strong inverse correlation between the water temperature in which lowland leopard frogs were captured and Bd prevalence, even after taking into account the influence of year, season, and host size. In locations where Bd was known to be present, the prevalence of Bd infections dropped from 75–100% in water ,15uC, to less than 10% in water .30uC. A strong inverse correlation between Bd infection status and water temperature was also observed within sites. Our findings suggest that microhabitats where water temperatures exceed 30uC provide lowland leopard frogs with significant protection from Bd, which could have important implications for disease dynamics, as well as management applications.

  {"id":"franco2004","abstract":"Elasticities of matrix elements from population projection matrices are commonly used to analyze the relative contributions of different life history transitions (birth, survival, growth) to the finite rate of increase (λ). Hitherto, comparative demography based on matrix models has relied upon decomposing elasticity matrices into blocks, each containing matrix elements deemed to represent recruitment, stasis, or progression to larger size classes. Elasticities across an entire matrix always sum to unity, and different populations and species can be compared on the basis of the relative proportions of these three variables. This method has been widely used, but it contains a weakness in that the value of matrix elements is a function of more than one vital rate. For example, transitions representing progression to larger size classes involve a survival rate as well as a growth rate. Ideally, then, demographic comparisons between populations should be made using elasticities of vital rates themselves, rather than elasticities of matrix elements that are compounds of those rates. Here, we employ the complete set of general equations for the elasticity of vital rates in an entirely new analysis of matrices for 102 species of perennial plants. The results show a surprising similarity to an earlier analysis based upon matrix element elasticity and provide important confirmation of general patterns of correlation between plant life history and demography. In addition, we show that individual vital rate elasticities cannot, on their own, predict variation in life history. Therefore, all three demographic processes (survival, growth, and reproduction) are necessary to account for life history variation. The new analysis provides a firmer foundation for comparative demography.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Franco","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Silvertown","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"franco2004","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/02-0651","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"531-538","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A comparative demography of plants based upon elasticities of vital rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/02-0651","volume":"85"},
  {"id":"freitas2020","abstract":"The designation of taxonomic units has important implications for the understanding and conservation of biodiversity. Eurasian vipers are a monophyletic group of viperid snakes (Serpentes, Viperinae), currently comprising four genera (Daboia, Macrovipera, Montivipera and Vipera) and up to 40 species. Taxonomic units have been described using a wide variety of methods and criteria, and consequently, considerable controversy still surrounds the validity of some currently listed species. In order to promote a consensus- and evidence-based taxonomy of Eurasian vipers, we analysed published mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences for this group to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among currently recognized viper species. We also compiled information on external morphology to assess their morphological distinctiveness. Phylogenetic inference based on mtDNA sequences shows contrasting levels of divergence across genera and species and identiﬁes several instances of non-monophyly in described species. Nuclear DNA sequences show extremely low levels of genetic variation, with a widespread pattern of allele sharing among distant species, and even among genera. Revision of morphological data shows that most species designations rely on scalation traits that overlap extensively among species of the same genus. Based on our combined assessment, we recognize 15 taxa as valid species, three taxa which likely represent species complexes, 17 taxa of doubtful validity as species, and ﬁve taxa for which species status is maintained but further research is highly recommended to assess taxonomic arrangements. We stress the need to implement integrative taxonomic approaches for the recognition of evidence-based taxonomic units in Eurasian vipers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Freitas","given":"Inês"},{"family":"Ursenbacher","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Mebert","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Zinenko","given":"Oleksandr"},{"family":"Schweiger","given":"Silke"},{"family":"Wüster","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Brito","given":"José C."},{"family":"Crnobrnja-Isailović","given":"Jelka"},{"family":"Halpern","given":"Bálint"},{"family":"Fahd","given":"Soumia"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Pleguezuelos","given":"Juan M."},{"family":"Joger","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Orlov","given":"Nikolay"},{"family":"Mizsei","given":"Edvárd"},{"family":"Lourdais","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Zuffi","given":"Marco A.

  {"id":"fuller2022","abstract":"Designing a population monitoring program for Asian bears presents challenges associated with their low densities and detectability, generally large home ranges, and logistical or resource constraints. The use of an occupancy-based method to monitor bear populations can be appropriate under certain conditions given the mechanistic relationship between occupancy and abundance. The form of the occupancy–abundance relationship is dependent on species-specific characteristics such as home range size and population density, as well as study area size. To assess the statistical power of tests to detect population change of Asian bears, we conducted a study using a range of scenarios by simulating spatially explicit individual-based capture-recapture data from a demographically open model. Simulations assessed the power to detect changes in population density via changes in site-level occupancy or abundance through time, estimated using a standard occupancy model or a Royle-Nichols model, both with point detectors (representing camera traps). We used IUCN Red List criteria as a guide in selection of two population decline scenarios (20% and 50%), but we chose a shorter time horizon (10 years = 1 bear generation), meaning that declines were steeper than used for IUCN criteria (3 generations). Our simulations detected population declines of 50% with high power (>0.80) and low false positive rates (FPR: incorrectly detecting a decline) (<0.10) when detectors were spaced at > 0.67 times the home range diameter (home-range spacing ratio: HRSR, a measure of spatial correlation), such that bears would tend to overlap no more than two detectors. There was high (0.85) correlation between realized occupancy and N in these scenarios. The FPR increased as the HRSR decreased because of spatial correlation in the occupancy process induced when individual home ranges overlap multiple detectors. The mean statistical power to detect more gradual population declines (20% in 10 years) with HRSR > 0.67 was low for occupancy models 0.22 (maximum power 0.67) and Royle-Nichols models (0.24; maximum power 0.67), suggesting that declines of this magnitude may not be described reliably with 10 years of monitoring. Our results demonstrated that under many realistic scenarios that we explored, false positive rates were unacceptably high. We highlight that when designing occupancy studies, the spacing between point detectors be at least 0.67 times the diameter of the home range size of the larger sex (e.g., males) when the assumptions of the spatial capture-recapture model used for simulation are met.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"Angela K."},{"family":"Augustine","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Morin","given":"Dana J."},{"family":"Pigeon","given":"Karine"},{"family":"Boulanger","given":"John"},{"family":"Lee","given":"David C."},{"family":"Bisi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Garshelis","given":"David L."}],"citation-key":"fuller2022","container-title":"Global Ecology and Conservation","container-title-short":"Global Ecology and Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02075","ISSN":"2351-9894","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"page":"e02075","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The occupancy-abundance relationship and sampling designs using occupancy to monitor populations of Asian bears","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989422000774","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"furlan2016","abstract":"Imperfect sensitivity, or imperfect detection, is a feature of all survey methods that needs to be accounted for when interpreting survey results. Detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used to infer species distributions, yet the sensitivity of the technique has not been fully evaluated. Sensitivity, or the probability of detecting target DNA given it is present at a site, will depend on both the survey method and the concentration and dispersion of target DNA molecules at a site. We present a model to estimate target DNA concentration and dispersion at survey sites and to estimate the sensitivity of an eDNA survey method. We ﬁtted this model to data from a species-speciﬁc eDNA survey for Oriental weatherloach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, at three sites sampled in both autumn and spring. The concentration of target DNA molecules was similar at all three sites in autumn but much higher at two sites in spring. Our analysis showed the survey method had ≥95% sensitivity at sites where target DNA concentrations were ≥11 molecules per litre. We show how these data can be used to compare sampling schemes that differ in the number of ﬁeld samples collected per site and number of PCR replicates per sample to achieve ≥95% sensitivity at a given target DNA concentration. These models allow researchers to quantify the sensitivity of eDNA survey methods to optimize the probability of detecting target species, and to compare DNA concentrations spatially and temporarily.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Furlan","given":"Elise M."},{"family":"Gleeson","given":"Dianne"},{"family":"Hardy","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Richard P."}],"citation-key":"furlan2016","container-title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","container-title-short":"Mol Ecol Resour","DOI":"10.1111/1755-0998.12483","ISSN":"1755098X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"language":"en","page":"641-654","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A framework for estimating the sensitivity of eDNA surveys","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12483","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"gade2019","abstract":"Wildﬁre is an important natural disturbance event that promotes landscape heterogeneity and regulates many wildlife communities. The compounding eﬀects of ﬁre suppression and climate change have increased the frequency and severity of wildﬁre, but the responses of many organisms to wildﬁre is unknown. Landscape heterogeneity, speciﬁcally microhabitats, may mediate and buﬀer the eﬀects of wildﬁre, and evaluating variable responses to wildﬁre given habitat is key to developing a more cohesive understanding of population responses. Terrestrial plethodontid salamanders are likely disproportionality aﬀected by wildﬁre events because of their lungless anatomy and reliance on cool and moist habitats. Our knowledge of salamander responses to wildﬁre in the short-term is limited due to the inherent challenge of opportunistically studying post-wildﬁre events. We capitalized on a wildﬁre event in western North Carolina, USA to determine the short-term (6–18-month postﬁre) habitat-mediated responses of salamanders to wildﬁre using body size measurement and repeated count surveys. We observed precipitous declines of the red-legged salamander, Plethodon shermani, in exposed upland forests, but no apparent negative eﬀects in riparian forests 18-months post-ﬁre relative to unburned sites. We also observed a loss of juvenile size classes in the upland burned forest with only the largest adult individuals remaining 18-months post-ﬁre. There were no size class diﬀerences in the riparian forests. Our results suggest riparian forests may be buﬀered from the eﬀects of wildﬁre because canopy cover, vegetation, and soil duﬀ layer are retained following a wildﬁre event. Salamander populations inhabiting riparian forests may be at less risk of declining than those in exposed habitats. Our results underscore the need to assess wildﬁre eﬀects in all habitat types to fully determine the eﬀects of disturbance to populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Gade","given":"Meaghan R."},{"family":"Gould","given":"Philip R."},{"family":"Peterman","given":"William E."}],"citation-key":"gade2019","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117479","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","page":"117479","source":"Crossref","title":"Habitat-dependent responses of terrestrial salamanders to wildfire in the short-term","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112719300246","volume":"449"},
  {"id":"gaillard2003","abstract":"In an age- or stage-structured population, a given change on a proportional scale of different fitness components has different effects on the population growth rate. Because earlier studies have shown that variability is selectively disadvantageous for long-lived iteroparous species, fitness components whose variation has greatest impact on the population growth rate are expected to be canalized against temporal variability. We present here a test for such a canalization of fitness components most influential for population growth. If canalization occurs, (1) within a given population the variance of canalized fitness components should be less than that of noncanalized components, and (2) among populations an inverse relationship should occur between the potential demographic impact of fitness components and their temporal variability. We tested these hypotheses using data on age-dependent survival of ungulates. As expected for long-lived vertebrates, elasticities and sensitivities of adult survival were consistently higher than for juvenile survival. In support of the canalization hypothesis, the variance of juvenile survival with low potential demographic impact on fitness was consistently higher than the variance of adult survival with high potential demographic impact on fitness, in all of 22 ungulate populations for which long-term demographic monitoring data were available. However, a negative covariation between potential impact on fitness and temporal variation could also be accounted for by alternative hypotheses, the lower resistance of growing individuals to environmental “insults,” or reduced adult phenotypic variability due to selective mortality of juveniles. To differentiate between canalization of adult survival and frailty/selective mortality of juveniles, we included five populations of small mammals. We then found a negative relationship between the relative potential impact of age-dependent survival on fitness and the relative variability of age-dependent survival, especially for populations faced with high environmental variation. This remained true after correcting for differences in mean survival of juveniles and adults and was independent of phylogeny. Although more data are required to extend the hypothesis to other taxonomic groups, we conclude that available data support the idea that adult survival of ungulates is canalized against temporal variation. Therefore, contrasted responses of juvenile and prime-age survival to environmental variation in ungulates may be adaptive and could be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"Nigel Gilles"}],"citation-key":"gaillard2003","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/02-0409","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"3294-3306","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Temporal variation in survival of mammals: A case of environmental canalization?","title-short":"Temporal variation in survival of mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/02-0409","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"garcia2006","abstract":"When exploring the possible factors contributing to population declines, it is necessary to consider multiple, interacting environmental stressors. Here, we investigate the impact of 2 factors, ultraviolet radiation and disease, on the survival of anuran amphibians. Exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation increases mortality and results in various sub-lethal effects for many amphibian species. Infectious diseases can also negatively impact amphibian populations. In this study, we exposed metamorphic individuals (metamorphs) to both UV-B and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (BD), a fungal pathogen and cause of the disease chytridiomycosis, and monitored survival for 3 wk. We tested for possible interactions between UV-B and BD in 3 species: the Cascades frog Rana cascadae; the Western toad Bufo boreas; and the Pacific treefrog Hyla regilla. We found strong interspecific differences in susceptibility to BD. For example, R. cascadae suffered a large increase in mortality when exposed to BD; B. boreas also experienced mortality, but this effect was small relative to the R. cascadae response. H. regilla did not show any decrease in survival when exposed to either factor. No synergistic interactions between UV-B and BD were found for any of the test species. A previous study investigating the impact of BD on larval amphibians showed different species responses (Blaustein et al. 2005a). Our results highlight the importance of studying multiple life history stages when determining the impact of environmental stressors. The contrast between these 2 studies emphasizes how vulnerability to a pathogen can vary between life history stages within a single species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia","given":"T.

We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.","author":[{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"gelman2006","container-title":"Bayesian Analysis","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"515-533","source":"Zotero","title":"Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"gelman2008","abstract":"Interpretation of regression coefﬁcients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean ±1 standard deviation. The resulting coefﬁcients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option—an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data ﬁle—so that the magnitudes of coefﬁcients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

  {"id":"gelman2013","abstract":"Posterior predictive p-values do not in general have uniform distributions under the null hypothesis (except in the special case of ancillary test variables) but instead tend to have distributions more concentrated near 0.5. From diﬀerent perspectives, such nonuniform distributions have been portrayed as desirable (as reﬂecting an ability of vague prior distributions to nonetheless yield accurate posterior predictions) or undesirable (as making it more diﬃcult to reject a false model). We explore this tension through two simple normal-distribution examples. In one example, we argue that the low power of the posterior predictive check is desirable from a statistical perspective; in the other, the posterior predictive check seems inappropriate. Our conclusion is that the relevance of the p-value depends on the applied context, a point which (ironically) can be seen even in these two toy examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"gelman2013","container-title":"Electronic Journal of Statistics","container-title-short":"Electron.

Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison.

  {"id":"germano2009","abstract":"Translocations are important tools in the field of conservation. Despite increased use over the last few decades, the appropriateness of translocations for amphibians and reptiles has been debated widely over the past 20 years. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the suitability of amphibians and reptiles for translocation, we reviewed the results of amphibian and reptile translocation projects published between 1991 and 2006. The success rate of amphibian and reptile translocations reported over this period was twice that reported in an earlier review in 1991. Success and failure rates were independent of the taxonomic class (Amphibia or Reptilia) released. Reptile translocations driven by human–wildlife conflict mitigation had a higher failure rate than those motivated by conservation, and more recent projects of reptile translocations had unknown outcomes. The outcomes of amphibian translocations were significantly related to the number of animals released, with projects releasing over 1000 individuals being most successful. The most common reported causes of translocation failure were homing and migration of introduced individuals out of release sites and poor habitat. The increased success of amphibian and reptile translocations reviewed in this study compared with the 1991 review is encouraging for future conservation projects. Nevertheless, more preparation, monitoring, reporting of results, and experimental testing of techniques and reintroduction questions need to occur to improve translocations of amphibians and reptiles as a whole.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Germano","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Bishop","given":"Phillip J."}],"citation-key":"germano2009","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01123.x","ISSN":"08888892, 15231739","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",2]]},"language":"en","page":"7-15","source":"Crossref","title":"Suitability of amphibians and reptiles for translocation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01123.x","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"gerrodette2011","abstract":"Despite more than half a century of criticism, signiﬁcance testing continues to be used commonly by ecologists. Signiﬁcance tests are widely misused and misunderstood, and even when properly used, they are not very informative for most ecological data. Problems of misuse and misinterpretation include: (i) invalid logic; (ii) rote use; (iii) equating statistical signiﬁcance with biological importance; (iv) regarding the P-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true; (v) regarding the P-value as a measure of effect size; and (vi) regarding the P-value as a measure of evidence. Signiﬁcance tests are poorly suited for inference because they pose the wrong question. In addition, most null hypotheses in ecology are point hypotheses already known to be false, so whether they are rejected or not provides little additional understanding. Ecological data rarely ﬁt the controlled experimental setting for which signiﬁcance tests were developed. More satisfactory methods of inference assess the degree of support which data provide for hypotheses, measured in terms of information theory (model-based inference), likelihood ratios (likelihood inference) or probability (Bayesian inference). Modern statistical methods allow multiple data sets to be combined into a single likelihood framework, avoiding the loss of information that can occur when data are analyzed in separate steps. Inference based on signiﬁcance testing is compared with model-based, likelihood and Bayesian inference using data on an endangered porpoise, Phocoena sinus. All of the alternatives lead to greater understanding and improved inference than provided by a P-value and the associated statement of statistical signiﬁcance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerrodette","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"gerrodette2011","container-title":"Marine Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-0485.2011.00466.x","ISSN":"01739565","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"404-418","source":"Crossref","title":"Inference without significance: measuring support for hypotheses rather than rejecting them","title-short":"Inference without significance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2011.00466.x","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"gervasi2013","abstract":"Species composition within ecological assemblages can drive disease dynamics including pathogen invasion, spread, and persistence. In multi-host pathogen systems, interspecific variation in responses to infection creates important context dependency when predicting the outcome of disease. Here, we examine the responses of three sympatric host species to a single fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which is associated with worldwide amphibian population declines and extinctions. Using an experimental approach, we show that amphibian species from three different genera display significant differences in patterns of pathgen-induced mortality as well as the magnitude and temporal dynamics of infection load. We exposed amphibians to one of four inoculation dose treatments at both larval and post- metamorphic stages and quantified infection load on day 8 and day 15 post-inoculation. Of the three species examined, only one (the Pacific treefrog; Pseudacris regilla) displayed ‘‘dose-dependent’’ responses; survival was reduced and infection load was elevated as inoculation dose was increased. We observed a reduction in survival but no differences in infection load across pathogen treatments in Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae). Western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) displayed differences in infection load but no differences in survival across pathogen treatments. Within species, responses to the pathogen varied with life history stage, and the most heavily infected species at the larval stage was different from the most heavily infected species at the post-metamorphic stage. Temporal changes in infection load were species and life history stage-specific. We show that variation in susceptibility to this multi-host pathogen is complex when viewed at a fine-scale and may be mediated through intrinsic host traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gervasi","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Gondhalekar","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Deanna H."},{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."}],"citation-key":"gervasi2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0054490","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,24]]},"language":"en","page":"e54490","source":"Crossref","title":"Host identity matters in the amphibian-<i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> system: Fine-scale patterns of variation in responses to a multi-host pathogen","title-short":"Host Identity Matters in the Amphibian-Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054490","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"geyle2021","abstract":"More than a third of the world’s amphibian species are listed as Threatened or Extinct, with a recent assessment identifying 45 Australian frogs (18.4% of the currently recognised species) as ‘Threatened’ based on IUCN criteria. We applied structured expert elicitation to 26 frogs assessed as Critically Endangered and Endangered to estimate their probability of extinction by 2040. We also investigated whether participant experience (measured as a self-assigned categorical score, i.e. ‘expert’ or ‘non-expert’) influenced the estimates. Collation and analysis of participant opinion indicated that eight species are at high risk (.50% chance) of becoming extinct by 2040, with the disease chytridiomycosis identified as the primary threat. A further five species are at moderate–high risk (30–50% chance), primarily due to climate change. Fourteen of the 26 frog species are endemic to Queensland, with many species restricted to small geographic ranges that are susceptible to stochastic events (e.g. a severe heatwave or a large bushfire). Experts were more likely to rate extinction probability higher for poorly known species (those with ,10 experts), while non-experts were more likely to rate extinction probability higher for better-known species. However, scores converged following discussion, indicating that there was greater consensus in the estimates of extinction probability. Increased resourcing and management intervention are urgently needed to avert future extinctions of Australia’s frogs. Key priorities include developing and supporting captive management and establishing or extending in-situ population refuges to alleviate the impacts of disease and climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Geyle","given":"Hayley M."},{"family":"Hoskin","given":"Conrad J."},{"family":"Bower","given":"Deborah S."},{"family":"Catullo","given":"Renee"},{"family":"Clulow","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Driessen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Katrina"},{"family":"Garnett","given":"Stephen T."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Deon"},{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey W."},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Hines","given":"Harry B."},{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Emily P."},{"family":"Hollis","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David A."},{"family":"Lemckert","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Marantelli","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Nicola J."},{"family":"Newell","given":"David"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"J.

However, few studies have documented the real-time host/pathogen dynamics during the arrival of Bd and the decline of an amphibian population. Diagnosing population declines is difﬁcult because multiple factors may be involved and data are often inadequate. However, identifying the relative impact among different threatening processes is critical to understanding population declines. We report the decline and extinction of a population of a threatened temperate montane frog species Litoria spenceri in south-eastern Australia. Unlike most threatened species at the time, its ecology and population demography were well understood, and a monitoring programme was in place, enabling prompt detection of the decline and evaluation of its cause. Histology for Bd on a unique series of phalange samples showed that the decline was strongly linked to the arrival and increased prevalence of Bd, estimated to have emerged in the population within 39 days of ﬁrst detection. Our study provides the ﬁrst real-time observation of a mass die-off and decline in a temperate Australian species and the ﬁrst tight estimate of Bd arrival in a declining population in Australia. These ﬁndings not only provide further evidence that Bd has contributed to amphibian declines but also demonstrates how Bd may work in concert with other threatening processes, resulting in extinction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gillespie","given":"G.

  {"id":"gillespie2020","abstract":"Coherent, multi-species conservation strategies rely on up-to-date assessments of extinction risk, and prioritising and implementing well-founded management and research actions. Using IUCN criteria and methods, we reassessed the conservation status of all 243 Australian frog species. We also identiﬁed key threats and associated potential management actions. We subsequently scored the relative value, feasibility and current levels of implementation of all management and research actions for threatened and Data Deﬁcient species. These scores were then used to rank the relative priority of management and research actions, identifying the highest priority actions for reducing extinction risk for Australia's frogs. Our revised assessment identiﬁed 45 threatened frog species in Australia, a 10% reduction from the 2004 assessment. However, the number of species assessed as Extinct increased by two, and four species were added to the Critically Endangered list. Improvements in conservation status for some species resulted from better knowledge and natural population stabilisation or recovery following disease impacts, rather than as a consequence of management. Improved knowledge has also resulted in a reduction of Data Deﬁcient species from ten to eight. We found substantial reductions in species extinction risk may be achievable by implementing a relatively discrete set of well-targeted management and research actions. Given its simple and dynamic nature, our method can be regularly updated with new information, and can also be applied at diﬀerent geographic scales.

  {"id":"gog2002","abstract":"Conventional applications of metapopulation theory have suggested that increasing migration between patches is usually good for conservation. A recent analysis by Hess has pointed out a possible exception to this: when infectious disease is present, migration may promote disease spread and therefore increase local extinction. We extend Hess's model to discuss this problem: when infections have spilled over from more abundant alternative hosts. This is often the case for species of conservation concern, and we find that Hess's conclusions must be substantially modified. We use deterministic analytic and stochastic numerical approaches to show that movement between patches will rarely have a negative impact, even when the probability of external infection is low.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gog","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Woodroffe","given":"Rosie"},{"family":"Swinton","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"gog2002","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2001.1667","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1492","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4,7]]},"page":"671-676","PMCID":"PMC1690941","PMID":"11934357","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Disease in endangered metapopulations: the importance of alternative hosts","title-short":"Disease in endangered metapopulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690941/","volume":"269"},
  {"id":"golding2016","abstract":"Species distribution modelling (SDM) is widely used in ecology, and predictions of species distributions inform both policy and ecological debates. Therefore, methods with high predictive accuracy and those that enable biological interpretation are preferable. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a highly flexible approach to statistical modelling and have recently been proposed for SDM. GP models fit smooth, but potentially complex response functions that can account for high-dimensional interactions between predictors. We propose fitting GP SDMs using deterministic numerical approximations, rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to make GPs more computationally efficient and easy to use. We introduce GP models and their application to SDM, illustrate how ecological knowledge can be incorporated into GP SDMs via Bayesian priors and formulate a simple GP SDM that can be fitted efficiently. This model can be fitted either by learning the hyperparameters or by using a fixed approximation to them. Using a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey data set, we compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of these models with several commonly used SDM approaches for both presence/absence and presence-only data. Predictive accuracy of GP SDMs fitted by Laplace approximation was greater than boosted regression trees, generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression when trained on presence/absence data and greater than all of these models plus MaxEnt when trained on presence-only data. GP SDMs fitted using a fixed approximation to hyperparameters were no less accurate than those with MAP estimation and on average 70 times faster, equivalent in speed to GAMs. As well as having strong predictive power for this data set, GP SDMs offer a convenient method for incorporating prior knowledge of the species' ecology. By fitting these methods using efficient numerical approximations, they may easily be applied to large data sets and automatically for many species. An r package, GRaF, is provided to enable SDM users to fit GP models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Golding","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Purse","given":"Bethan V."}],"citation-key":"golding2016","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12523","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"598-608","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fast and flexible Bayesian species distribution modelling using Gaussian processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12523","volume":"7"},

As a result a two day 'National Threatened Frog Workshop' was held at the University of Canberra in November 1997 sponsored by Environment Australia, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the University of Canberra and the Worldwide Fund for Nature.The Workshop brought together some 80 people from throughout Australia and overseas involved in frog research, management and policy development and included representatives from government agencies, educational institutions and non-government organisations. The purpose of the Workshop was to: 1. provide an overview of the current status of knowledge about species which are declining; 2. provide an overview of what's known about the decline and how it is being tackled; 3. identify gaps in knowledge; 4. recommend priorities for notional effort for research, management and community attention; 5. help set future priority actions for the Working Group; and 6. establish on-going communication links between all participants and the wider community. Following the Workshop the Working Group met and emphasised: the need to maintain a broad perspective and to continue monitoring and research on a range of possible causal factors; the need to support research into new areas - particularly disease as a potentially major factor influencing global declines; the need to support strategic research and to develop protocols to address this issue; and the need to support research on fluctuating asymmetry as a possible early warning tool for predicting declines. They also requested that the workshop proceedings be published; that a brochure on declining frogs be prepared; that a web site to provide up to date information about declining frog issues be established and that a national but restricted internet discussion group on frogs should be established.y, it.","author":[{"family":"Goldingay","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Newell","given":"David"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"goldingay1999","container-title":"Declines and disappearances of Australian frogs","editor":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Alastair"}],"event-place":"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","ISBN":"978-0-642-54656-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 44894378","page":"64-93","publisher":"Biodiversity Group, Environment Australia","publisher-place":"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The status of rainforest stream frogs in north-eastern New South Wales: decline or recovery?","type":"chapter"},

The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is one species that is adversely affected by urban development. Sick and injured koalas in the Lismore urban area are regularly taken into care. We radio-tracked koalas released from care in order to estimate home-range areas and to determine their fate. Koalas were tracked for periods of 90–742 days; 7 of 10 survived for a period of at least one year. Home ranges defined by the minimum convex polygon (MCP100%) were large (mean ± s.e. = 37.4 ± 8.2 ha). Analysis using the 95% Fixed Kernel revealed home-range areas of 8.0 ± 1.7 ha. Analysis of the habitat composition of each MCP home range showed that they included 4.3 ± 0.9 ha of primary habitat (dominated by their primary food trees). These home ranges contained 27.6 ± 6.8 ha of non-habitat (cleared or developed land). Koalas crossed roads within their home ranges at least 5–53 times; one crossed the Bruxner Highway near a roundabout at least 32 times over his 2-year tracking period. Future management should include strategic food tree planting that enhances habitat connectivity and minimises the risk of car strike or dog attack.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldingay","given":"Ross L."},{"family":"Dobner","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"goldingay2013","container-title":"Australian Mammalogy","container-title-short":"Aust.

It has been targeted for exploitation to satisfy the international pet trade and zoological collections since it was described. Long-term intensive exploitation and habitat destruction have resulted in drastic reductions in wild populations, pushing this rare species towards extinction. Since 1990 only limited investigations have been conducted and the most optimistic estimation of the population size was 300–500 individuals, in 2000. Since then, however, there have been no updates on the population status of this snake in the wild. To provide baseline data for eﬀective conservation of this species we conducted a study of its status and distribution, during 2007–2010. Only eight individuals were found during ﬁeldwork and we documented the illegal harvesting of . 30. The total population of the species was estimated to be 462, occupying c. 105 km2 in the Nanling Mountain Range. The black market price of a Mangshan pit viper is currently . USD 1,000 kg−1 and illegal trade has led to over-harvesting, which is the greatest threat to the species.

  {"id":"gorman2013","abstract":"Although fire is recognized as an important disturbance in longleaf pine uplands of the southeastern US, less is known about the importance of fire or other disturbances in the wetlands embedded within this ecosystem. The reticulated flatwoods salamander (Ambystoma bishopi), a federally endangered species, and other rare and declining amphibians, are less likely to breed in low-quality wetlands with high canopy cover and low herbaceous groundcover that typically occur from fire exclusion. Fire rarely carries through these wetlands during winter because of the presence of standing water at this time of year. Our objective was to evaluate whether mechanical removal of the woody midstory could serve as a surrogate for fire, and create high-quality wetlands with moderate canopy cover and high herbaceous groundcover. We chose a series of high-quality (n = 4) and low-quality (n = 21) ephemeral wetlands for study. A subset of the low-quality wetlands were then treated mechanically and with herbicide (n = 8), burned (n = 4), or retained in a low-quality state (n = 7). Mechanical treatments reduced canopy cover (from 55.7 % to 41.4 %) to similar levels as high-quality sites (36.7 %); however, herbaceous groundcover did not increase (17.2 % post-treatment compared to 37.3 % at high-quality sites). Fire reduced the canopy cover (from 41.3 % to 33.0 %), and herbaceous groundcover was similar (33.2 % post treatment) to high-quality sites as of four months post burn. More time will be required to assess the response of herbaceous groundcover and whether mechanical methods can be used as a surrogate for fire to restore amphibian breeding habitat. Identifying surrogates for fire could add an important technique to our management toolbox.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorman","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Haas","given":"Carola A."},{"family":"Himes","given":"John G."}],"citation-key":"gorman2013","container-title":"Fire Ecology","DOI":"10.4996/fireecology.0901096","ISSN":"1933-9747","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4]]},"language":"en","page":"96-109","source":"Crossref","title":"Evaluating methods to restore amphibian habitat in fire-suppressed pine flatwoods wetlands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.4996/fireecology.0901096","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"gottschalk2005","abstract":"Improvements in assay technology have reduced the amount of random variation in measured responses to the point where even slight asymmetry of the assay data can be more signiﬁcant than random variation. Use of the ﬁve-parameter logistic (5PL) function to ﬁt dose–response data easily accommodates such asymmetry. The 5PL can dramatically improve the accuracy of asymmetric assays over the use of symmetric models such as the four-parameter logistic (4PL) function. Until recently, however, the process of ﬁtting the 5PL function has been diﬃcult, with the result that the 4PL function has continued to be used even for highly asymmetric data. Various ad hoc modiﬁcations of the 4PL method have been developed in an attempt to address asymmetric data. However, recent advances in numerical methods and assay analysis software have rendered easier the ﬁtting of the 5PL routine. This paper demonstrates how use of the 5PL function can improve assay performance over the 4PL and its variants. Speciﬁcally, the improvement in the accuracy of concentration estimates that can be obtained using the 5PL over the 4PL as a function of the asymmetry present in the data is studied. The behavior of the 5PL curve and how it diﬀers from the 4PL curve are discussed. Common experimental designs, which can lead to ill-conditioned regression problems, are also examined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gottschalk","given":"Paul G."},{"family":"Dunn","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"gottschalk2005","container-title":"Analytical Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Analytical Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.035","ISSN":"00032697","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",8]]},"language":"en","page":"54-65","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The five-parameter logistic: A characterization and comparison with the four-parameter logistic","title-short":"The five-parameter logistic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003269705003313","volume":"343"},
  {"id":"goudie2018","abstract":"MultiBUGS is a new version of the general-purpose Bayesian modelling software BUGS that implements a generic algorithm for parallelising Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to speed up posterior inference of Bayesian models. The algorithm parallelises evaluation of the product-form likelihoods formed when a parameter has many children in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation; and parallelises sampling of conditionally-independent sets of parameters. A heuristic algorithm is used to decide which approach to use for each parameter and to apportion computation across computational cores. This enables MultiBUGS to automatically parallelise the broad range of statistical models that can be ﬁtted using BUGS-language software, making the dramatic speed-ups of modern multi-core computing accessible to applied statisticians, without requiring any experience of parallel programming. We demonstrate the use of MultiBUGS on simulated data designed to mimic a hierarchical e-health linked-data study of methadone prescriptions including 425,112 observations and 20,426 random eﬀects. Posterior inference for the e-health model takes several hours in existing software, but MultiBUGS can perform inference in only 28 minutes using 48 computational cores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Goudie","given":"Robert J.

  {"id":"gould1998","abstract":"Temporal variation of demographic characteristics for animal populations is of interest to both ecologists and biological modelers. The standard deviation of a series of estimated parameter values (e.g., estimated population size) or some function thereof (e.g., log of the estimated parameters) is commonly used as a measure of temporal variability. These measures of temporal variation overestimate the true temporal variation by not accounting for sampling variability inherent to the estimation of unknown population parameters. Using a variance-components approach to partitioning the total variability of an estimated parameter, we demonstrate the ease with which sampling variation can be removed from the observed total variation of parameter estimates. Estimates of temporal variability of survival are given after removal of sampling variation for three bird species: the federally listed Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii), Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus), and Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Sampling variation accounted for the majority of the total variation in the survival estimates for nearly all of the populations studied. Substantial differences in observed significance levels were observed when testing for demographic differences in temporal variation using temporal variance estimates adjusted and unadjusted for sampling variance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gould","given":"William R."},{"family":"Nichols","given":"James D."}],"citation-key":"gould1998","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2531:EOTVOS]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"2531-2538","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Estimation of temporal variability of survival in animal populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658%281998%29079%5B2531%3AEOTVOS%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"79"},

  {"id":"gray2016","abstract":"The endangered black-tailed dusky antechinus (Antechinus arktos) was described in 2014, so most aspects of its ecology are unknown. We examined diet composition and prey selection of A. arktos and a sympatric congener, the northern form of A. stuartii, at two sites in Springbrook National Park. Overall, taxa from 25 invertebrate orders were identiﬁed in the diets from 252 scat samples. Dietary components were similar for each species, but A. arktos consumed a higher frequency and volume of dipteran larvae and Diplopoda, while A. stuartii consumed more Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera and Isopoda. Both species of Antechinus had a higher percentage of ‘empty’ scats (devoid of any identiﬁable invertebrate material) in 2014 compared with 2015. The former was a drier year overall. Lower rainfall may have reduced abundance and diversity of arthropod prey, causing both species to supplement their diet with soft-bodied prey items such as earthworms, which are rarely detected in scats. Comparison of prey in scats with invertebrate captures from pitfall traps showed both species to be dietary generalists, despite exhibiting distinct preference and avoidance of certain prey categories. The ability of an endangered generalist marsupial to switch prey may be particularly advantageous considering the anticipated effects of climate change on Gondwanan rainforests during the mid-late 21st century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Emma L."},{"family":"Burwell","given":"Chris J."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Andrew M."}],"citation-key":"gray2016","container-title":"Australian Journal of Zoology","DOI":"10.1071/ZO16044","ISSN":"0004-959X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"249","source":"Crossref","title":"Benefits of being a generalist carnivore when threatened by climate change: the comparative dietary ecology of two sympatric semelparous marsupials, including a new endangered species (<i>Antechinus arktos</i>)","title-short":"Benefits of being a generalist carnivore when threatened by climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO16044","volume":"64"},

The genus Antechinus has recently been revised, seeing four new species named and one existing subspecies raised to species status. Here, we present the first ecological assessment of one new species, the endangered black-tailed dusky antechinus (Antechinus arktos), based on a 2-year mark-recapture study of two proximate sites within the cloud forest of Springbrook National Park, southeast Queensland, Australia. We also present comparative ecological data from a sympatric congener, Antechinus stuartii. In total, 103 A. arktos (49 male; 54 female) and 2125 A. stuartii (1229 male; 896 female) captures were made over 16,630 trap nights at the two sites. The occurrence and synchrony of reproductive events observed in A. arktos closely parallel the semelparous reproductive strategy exhibited by all congeners studied to date. The A. arktos populations mate during midSeptember, with birth of up to six young occurring during mid-October. The low abundance and fecundity, together with a limited and apparently retracting distribution, suggest A. arktos is under threat of climate-induced extinction in the coming decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Emma L."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Andrew M."},{"family":"Firn","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"gray2017","container-title":"Mammal Research","DOI":"10.1007/s13364-016-0281-1","ISSN":"2199-2401, 2199-241X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1]]},"language":"en","page":"47-63","source":"Crossref","title":"Autecology of a new species of carnivorous marsupial, the endangered black-tailed dusky antechinus (<i>Antechinus arktos</i>), compared to a sympatric congener, the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13364-016-0281-1","volume":"62"},

  {"id":"green2003","abstract":"Even among widespread species with high reproductive potentials and signiﬁcant dispersal abilities, the probability of extinctions should be correlated both with population size variance and with the extent of population isolation. To address how variation in demographic characteristics and habitat requirements may reﬂect on the comparative risk of species decline, I examined 617 time series of population census data derived from 89 amphibian species using the normalized estimate of the realized rate of increase, ÁN, and its variance. Amphibians are demonstrably in general decline and exhibit a great range of dispersal abilities, demographic characteristics, and population sizes. I compared species according to life-history characteristics and habitat use. Among the populations examined, census declines outnumbered increases yet the average magnitudes for both declines and increases were not demonstrably diﬀerent, substantiating ﬁndings of amphibian decline. This gives no support for the idea that amphibian population sizes are dictated by regimes featuring relatively rare years of high recruitment oﬀset by intervening years of gradual decline such that declines may outnumber increases without negative eﬀect. For any given population size, those populations living in large streams or in ponds had signiﬁcantly higher variance than did populations of completely terrestrial or other stream-dwelling amphibians. This could not be related to life-history complexity as all the stream-breeding species examined have larvae and all of the wholly terrestrial species have direct development without a larval stage. Variance in ÁN was highest amongst the smallest populations in each comparison group. Estimated local extinction rates averaged 3.1% among pond-breeding frogs, 2.2% for pond-breeding salamanders, and negligible for both stream-breeding and terrestrial direct-developing species. Recoveries slightly exceeded extinctions among European pond-breeding frogs but not among North American pond-breeding frogs. Less common species had greater negative disparities between extinctions and recoveries. Species with highly ﬂuctuating populations and high frequencies of local extinctions living in changeable environments, such pond- and torrent-breeding amphibians, may be especially susceptible to curtailment of dispersal and restriction of habitat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"green2003","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/S0006-3207(02)00302-6","ISSN":"00063207","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6]]},"language":"en","page":"331-343","source":"Crossref","title":"The ecology of extinction: population fluctuation and decline in amphibians","title-short":"The ecology of extinction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320702003026","volume":"111"},
  {"id":"greenberg2016","abstract":"Forest restoration efforts commonly employ silvicultural methods that alter light and competition to inﬂuence species composition. Changes to forest structure and microclimate may adversely affect some taxa (e.g., terrestrial salamanders), but positively affect others (e.g., early successional birds). Salamanders are cited as indicators of ecosystem health because of their sensitivity to forest ﬂoor microclimate. We used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps in a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact design to experimentally assess herpetofaunal community response to initial application of three silvicultural methods proposed to promote oak regeneration: prescribed burning; midstory herbicide; and shelterwood harvests (initial treatment of the shelterwood-burn method) and controls, before and for ﬁve years post-treatment. Species richness of all herpetofauna, amphibians, reptiles, frogs, salamanders, or snakes was unaffected by any treatment, but lizard species richness increased in the shelterwood harvest. Capture rate of total salamanders decreased post-harvest in shelterwood units after a 2–3 year delay; Plethodon teyahalee decreased post-harvest in shelterwoods, but also in control units. In contrast, capture rate of total lizards and Plestiodon fasciatus increased in shelterwood stands within the ﬁrst year post-harvest. Prescribed burn and midstory herbicide treatments did not affect any reptile or amphibian species. A marginally lower proportion of juvenile to adult P. teyahalee, and a higher proportion of juvenile P. fasciatus in shelterwood than control units suggested that heavy canopy removal and associated change in microclimate may differentially affect reproductive success among species. Our study illustrates the importance of longer-term studies to detect potential changes in herpetofaunal communities that may not be immediately apparent after disturbances, and highlights the importance of including multiple taxa for a balanced perspective when weighing impacts of forest management activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Cathryn H."},{"family":"Moorman","given":"Christopher E."},{"family":"Raybuck","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"Sundol","given":"Chad"},{"family":"Keyser","given":"Tara L."},{"family":"Bush","given":"Janis"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Dean M."},{"family":"Warburton","given":"Gordon S."}],"citation-key":"greenberg2016","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2016.06.023","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]},"language":"en","page":"139-149","source":"Crossref","title":"Reptile and amphibian response to oak regeneration treatments in productive southern Appalachian hardwood forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112716303206","volume":"377"},

We experimentally assessed long-term (intermittent years, 2003–2016) effects of repeated dormant-season mechanical and prescribed ﬁre treatments on capture rates of reptiles and amphibians in southern Appalachian upland hardwood forests. Treatments were mechanical understory removal (twice), prescribed burning (4 times; burn-only), mechanical understory removal followed 1 year later by high-severity prescribed burns and 3 subsequent burns (mechanical þ burn), and untreated controls. Initial burns were hotter in mechanical þ burn than burnonly units, resulting in heavy tree mortality and increased canopy openness within 2 growing-seasons postburn. We captured 4,606 individuals of 15 amphibian and 20 reptile species. Capture rates of American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), green frogs (Lithobates clamitans), plethodontid salamanders (Plethodon spp.), and northern red salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) were not affected by any fuel reduction treatment. The capture rate of ﬁve-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) was greater in mechanical þ burn than burn-only or control units, and the capture rate of eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) was greater in mechanical þ burn than control units. Juvenile eastern fence lizard captures were greater in mechanical þ burn units and increased over time, indicating that high-severity burning followed by repeated burns may improve conditions for successful recruitment.

  {"id":"greenberg2018a","abstract":"Growing-season burns are increasingly used in upland hardwood forest for multiple forest management goals. Many species of reptiles and amphibians are ground-dwelling, potentially increasing their vulnerability to prescribed ﬁre, especially during the growing-season when they are most active. We used drift fences with pitfall traps to experimentally assess how herpetofaunal species and communities responded to early, growing-season burns, dormant-season burns, and unburned controls. We documented no adverse eﬀects of either growingseason burns or dormant-season burns on any common herpetofaunal taxa, but capture rates of total, adult, and juvenile ﬁve-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) were greater following growing-season burns. Most measurements reﬂected little or transient change in forest structure. However, canopy cover decreased by an average of 16% in growing-season burns within four growing-seasons of burning, with some tree mortality in patches where ﬁre temperature likely was hotter. Our study suggests that even modest reductions in canopy cover may positively aﬀect relative abundance and reproductive success of P. fasciatus. We cautiously suggest that a higher mean ground-level ﬁre temperature and the physiologically active condition of vegetation in growing-season burns interacted to damage a greater proportion of trees, resulting in more canopy thinning than in dormant-season burns. However, weather, fuel types and condition, vegetation structure, and topography interact to aﬀect ﬁre intensity and the level of mortality or damage to canopy trees within and among stands, regardless of season conducted. We suggest that herpetofaunal response, for the species we studied, is more closely linked to change in canopy cover than to season of burn per se.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Cathryn H."},{"family":"Seiboldt","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Keyser","given":"Tara L."},{"family":"McNab","given":"W.

  {"id":"greene2016","abstract":"Open canopy conditions in southeastern pine (Pinus spp.) forests were historically maintained by frequent ﬁre and other disturbances, without which midstory hardwoods create closed canopy conditions limiting value of pine stands for many endemic, disturbance-adapted species. Intensively managed pine forests, which comprise 19% of forests in the southeastern U.S., can emulate historical open pine conditions, providing appropriate vegetation structure and composition for many endemic species. However, exact mechanisms for producing and maintaining open pine conditions and subsequent effects on biodiversity have not been examined across regions and stand ages. To better inform managers about options for providing open pine conditions in intensively managed pine stands, we used meta-analyses to examine biodiversity and open pine focal species responses to 5 stand establishment intensities and 4 midrotation practices (prescribed ﬁre, selective herbicide, ﬁre and herbicide combination, and thinning). We calculated 1742 biodiversity and 169 open pine focal species effect sizes from 42 publications of manipulative studies at 14 unique study sites in managed loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) forests in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains of the southeastern U.S. We quantiﬁed diversity and abundance responses by taxa and management practices for vegetation, birds, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, and invertebrates. Diversity and abundance responses generally decreased as stand establishment intensity increased, but those reductions appeared to be short-term (<3 years). Birds and open pine focal species responded positively to chemical stand establishment relative to a mechanically-prepared control. Thinning elicited positive diversity and abundance responses from reptiles and small mammals. Effects of prescribed ﬁre, selective herbicide, and their combination on biodiversity responses varied by taxa (e.g., following ﬁre, vegetative and avian diversity increased but amphibian and invertebrate diversity decreased). Further research is warranted on under-represented taxa (e.g., herpetofauna and invertebrates) in literature and long-term effects of forest management on biodiversity. Understanding how silvicultural management practices produce and maintain open pine forest conditions and inﬂuence biodiversity responses is necessary to inform opportunities for open-pine wildlife communities in working forested landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Rachel E."},{"family":"Iglay","given":"Raymond B."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Kristine O."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Darren A."},{"family":"Wigley","given":"T.

Effects of B. dendrobatidis on frog species are variable. Some species typically develop nonlethal infections and may function as carriers; others typically develop lethal infections that can lead to population declines. Nonlethal infections in the bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) are well-documented. In contrast, recently metamorphosed wood frogs (L. sylvaticus) can die from chytridiomycosis. We conducted an ex-situ experiment between May and July 2010 to determine whether B. dendrobatidis-infected bullfrogs could transmit the fungus to wood frog tadpoles when the two species shared a body of water. We tested for B. dendrobatidis infections with quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) in a subsample of the wood frog tadpoles and in all metamorphosed wood frogs and compared risk of death of froglets exposed and unexposed to infected bullfrogs. We detected B. dendrobatidis sporadically in subsampled treatment tadpoles (nine of 90, 10%) and frequently in treatment froglets (112 of 113, 99.1%). Pooled risk of froglet death was higher (P,0.001) in treatment enclosures than in control enclosures. Our results indicate that, at the low infection loads bullfrogs tend to carry, swabbing for PCR analyses may underestimate prevalence of B. dendrobatidis in this species. We highlight bullfrog disease screening as a management challenge, especially in light of exotic bullfrog colonies on multiple continents and large-scale global trade in this species.

  {"id":"griffiths2008","abstract":"The global amphibian crisis has resulted in renewed interest in captive breeding as a conservation tool for amphibians. Although captive breeding and reintroduction are controversial management actions, amphibians possess a number of attributes that make them potentially good models for such programs. We reviewed the extent and effectiveness of captive breeding and reintroduction programs for amphibians through an analysis of data from the Global Amphibian Assessment and other sources. Most captive breeding and reintroduction programs for amphibians have focused on threatened species from industrialized countries with relatively low amphibian diversity. Out of 110 species in such programs, 52 were in programs with no plans for reintroduction that had conservation research or conservation education as their main purpose. A further 39 species were in programs that entailed captive breeding and reintroduction or combined captive breeding with relocations of wild animals. Nineteen species were in programs with relocations of wild animals only. Eighteen out of 58 reintroduced species have subsequently bred successfully in the wild, and 13 of these species have established self-sustaining populations. As with threatened amphibians generally, amphibians in captive breeding or reintroduction programs face multiple threats, with habitat loss being the most important. Nevertheless, only 18 out of 58 reintroduced species faced threats that are all potentially reversible. When selecting species for captive programs, dilemmas may emerge between choosing species that have a good chance of surviving after reintroduction because their threats are reversible and those that are doomed to extinction in the wild as a result of irreversible threats. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs for amphibians require long-term commitments to ensure success, and different management strategies may be needed for species earmarked for reintroduction and species used for conservation research and education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Pavajeau","given":"Lissette"}],"citation-key":"griffiths2008","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00967.x","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"language":"en","page":"852-861","source":"Crossref","title":"Captive breeding, reintroduction, and the conservation of amphibians","title-short":"Captive breeding, reintroduction, and the conservation of amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00967.x","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"grogan2017","abstract":"Infectious diseases can be key threatening processes for biodiversity conservation. However, establishing the relative importance of disease (among other threatening processes) as a driver of species declines can be challenging. Bias in the directions that a research ﬁeld may take as it develops – due to factors such as conservation policy, funding, public perception, and available expertise and technology – may exacerbate this diﬃculty. Chlamydiosis (infection with bacteria in Family Chlamydiaceae) is an example of an infectious disease with a poorly understood role in koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population dynamics. The arboreal folivorous koala is an internationally recognized iconic species of high conservation, sociocultural and economic value. To date, no studies have quantitatively examined the breadth and scope of research related to koala chlamydiosis, nor systematically identiﬁed the current research gaps. We systematically and quantitatively reviewed a comprehensive database of literature related to koala chlamydiosis, classiﬁed and examined the main foci of the research, and evaluated research gaps with the goal of assisting policy planning for funding further koala chlamydiosis research. We examined published literature with regard to journal category, authorship, funding, spatiotemporal scope, study foci and type, chlamydial species examined, methodological design and overall ﬁndings. Among the 117 peer-reviewed papers published between 1970 and 2016 that ﬁt our criteria, the most striking ﬁnding was the relative lack of population-level disease studies within the last two decades to examine mechanisms of chlamydial infection dynamics. This research gap is of particular concern given the potential role of Chlamydia in koala population declines, and the recent dramatic changes in our understanding of pathogen phylogeny and improved diagnostic approaches. Our results demonstrate a pressing need for future in situ comprehensive longitudinal population-level studies from diverse geographic regions. These studies must utilize up-to-date diagnostic methods capable of distinguishing chlamydial species and strains to elucidate the role of chlamydial infection in koala population declines and the underlying mechanisms involved. They should also employ rigorous epidemiological methodologies and evaluate co-infection, habitat, climatic and demographic data. Our ﬁndings suggest some key research gaps concerning koala chlamydiosis, and are hence important for guiding future research into koala chlamydiosis and conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"Ellis","given":"William"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Darryl"},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Kerlin","given":"Douglas H."},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish"}],"citation-key":"grogan2017","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2017.09.001","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11]]},"language":"en","page":"179-188","source":"Crossref","title":"Current trends and future directions in koala chlamydial disease research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717313575","volume":"215"},
  {"id":"grogan2018","abstract":"Potentiating the evolution of immunity is a promising strategy for addressing biodiversity diseases. Assisted selection for infection resistance may enable the recovery and persistence of amphibians threatened by chytridiomycosis, a devastating fungal skin disease threatening hundreds of species globally. However, knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the natural evolution of immunity to chytridiomycosis is limited. Understanding the mechanisms of such resistance may help speed-assisted selection. Using a transcriptomics approach, we examined gene expression responses of endangered alpine tree frogs (Litoria verreauxii alpina) to subclinical infection, comparing two long-exposed populations with a na€ıve population. We performed a blinded, randomized and controlled exposure experiment, collecting skin, liver and spleen tissues at 4, 8 and 14 days postexposure from 51 wild-caught captively reared infection-na€ıve adult frogs for transcriptome assembly and differential gene expression analyses. We analysed our results in conjunction with infection intensity data, and the results of a large clinical survival experiment run concurrently with individuals from the same clutches. Here, we show that frogs from an evolutionarily long-exposed and phenotypically more resistant population of the highly susceptible alpine tree frog demonstrate a more robust innate and adaptive immune response at the critical early subclinical stage of infection when compared with two more susceptible populations. These results are consistent with the occurrence of evolution of resistance against chytridiomycosis, help to explain underlying resistance mechanisms, and provide genes of potential interest and sequence data for future research. We recommend further investigation of cell-mediated immunity pathways, the role of interferons and mechanisms of lymphocyte suppression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"McFadden","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Harlow","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David A."},{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Mulvenna","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"grogan2018","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.14493","ISSN":"09621083","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"en","page":"919-934","source":"Crossref","title":"Evolution of resistance to chytridiomycosis is associated with a robust early immune response","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/mec.14493","volume":"27"},

We expand on a recently proposed broad investigative approach for disease, with a systematic framework outlining the speciﬁc types of individual- and population-scale empirical evidence required to demonstrate whether a pathogen is a component cause of declines in wild animal populations. Using koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population declines and their putative association with the bacterial disease chlamydiosis (Family Chlamydiaceae) as a case study, we review the relevant published literature and synthesize a logical conceptual argument based on our suggested framework. Available empirical evidence supports a role for chlamydiosis contributing to host mortality and sterility, and cannot rule out a role of chlamydiosis as a component cause of koala population declines. However, the relative importance of chlamydiosis (among other threatening processes) as a driver of changes in koala demography and autecology may diﬀer depending on the particular population or system examined, and this has yet to be elucidated over the koala's distributional range. Our approach allows us to highlight current research gaps in order to assist with future policy planning and conservation strategy.

  {"id":"grogan2020","abstract":"Amphibians are currently the most threatened vertebrate class, with the disease chytridiomycosis being a major contributor to their global declines. Chytridiomycosis is a frequently fatal skin disease caused by the fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). The severity and extent of the impact of the infection caused by these pathogens across modern Amphibia are unprecedented in the history of vertebrate infectious diseases. The immune system of amphibians is thought to be largely similar to that of other jawed vertebrates, such as mammals. However, amphibian hosts are both ectothermic and water‐dependent, which are characteristics favouring fungal proliferation. Although amphibians possess robust constitutive host defences, Bd/Bsal replicate within host cells once these defences have been breached. Intracellular fungal localisation may contribute to evasion of the induced innate immune response. Increasing evidence suggests that once the innate defences are surpassed, fungal virulence factors suppress the targeted adaptive immune responses whilst promoting an ineffectual inflammatory cascade, resulting in immunopathology and systemic metabolic disruption. Thus, although infections are contained within the integument, crucial homeostatic processes become compromised, leading to mortality. In this paper, we present an integrated synthesis of amphibian post‐metamorphic immunological responses and the corresponding outcomes of infection with Bd, focusing on recent developments within the field and highlighting future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"Humphries","given":"Josephine E."},{"family":"Robert","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Lanctôt","given":"Chantal M."},{"family":"Nock","given":"Catherine J."},{"family":"Newell","given":"David A."},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish I."}],"citation-key":"grogan2020","container-title":"Journal of Fungi","DOI":"10.3390/jof6040234","ISSN":"2309-608X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,19]]},"language":"en","page":"234","source":"Crossref","title":"Immunological aspects of chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/6/4/234","volume":"6"},

Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population.

In this study, we review the systematics of Ecuadorian glassfrogs, providing species accounts of all 60 species, including three new species described herein. For all Ecuadorian species, we provide new information on the evolution, morphology, biology, conservation, and distribution. We present a new molecular phylogeny for Centrolenidae and address cryptic diversity within the family. We employ a candidate species system and designate 24 putative new species that require further study to determine their species status. We find that, in some cases, currently recognized species lack justification; specifically, we place Centrolene gemmata and Centrolene scirtetes under the synonymy of Centrolene lynchi; C. guanacarum and C. bacata under the synonymy of Centrolene sanchezi; Cochranella phryxa under the synonymy of Cochranella resplendens; and Hyalinobatrachium ruedai under the synonymy of Hyalinobatrachium munozorum. We also find that diversification patterns are mostly congruent with allopatric speciation, facilitated by barriers to gene flow (e.g., valleys, mountains, linearity of the Andes), and that niche conservatism is a dominant feature in the family. Conservation threats are diverse, but habitat destruction and climate change are of particular concern. The most imperiled glassfrogs in Ecuador are Centrolene buckleyi, C. charapita, C. geckoidea, C. medemi, C. pipilata, Cochranella mache, Nymphargus balionotus, N. manduriacu, N. megacheirus, and N. sucre, all of which are considered Critically Endangered.

  {"id":"guillera-arroita2014","abstract":"In a recent paper, Welsh, Lindenmayer and Donnelly (WLD) question the usefulness of models that estimate species occupancy while accounting for detectability. WLD claim that these models are difficult to fit and argue that disregarding detectability can be better than trying to adjust for it. We think that this conclusion and subsequent recommendations are not well founded and may negatively impact the quality of statistical inference in ecology and related management decisions. Here we respond to WLD’s claims, evaluating in detail their arguments, using simulations and/or theory to support our points. In particular, WLD argue that both disregarding and accounting for imperfect detection lead to the same estimator performance regardless of sample size when detectability is a function of abundance. We show that this, the key result of their paper, only holds for cases of extreme heterogeneity like the single scenario they considered. Our results illustrate the dangers of disregarding imperfect detection. When ignored, occupancy and detection are confounded: the same na¨ıve occupancy estimates can be obtained for very different true levels of occupancy so the size of the bias is unknowable. Hierarchical occupancy models separate occupancy and detection, and imprecise estimates simply indicate that more data are required for robust inference about the system in question. As for any statistical method, when underlying assumptions of simple hierarchical models are violated, their reliability is reduced. Resorting in those instances where hierarchical occupancy models do no perform well to the na¨ıve occupancy estimator does not provide a satisfactory solution. The aim should instead be to achieve better estimation, by minimizing the effect of these issues during design, data collection and analysis, ensuring that the right amount of data is collected and model assumptions are met, considering model extensions where appropriate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Guillera-Arroita","given":"Gurutzeta"},{"family":"Lahoz-Monfort","given":"José J."},{"family":"MacKenzie","given":"Darryl I."},{"family":"Wintle","given":"Brendan A."},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"guillera-arroita2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0099571","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,30]]},"language":"en","page":"e99571","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ignoring imperfect detection in biological surveys is dangerous: A response to ‘Fitting and interpreting occupancy models'","title-short":"Ignoring imperfect detection in biological surveys is dangerous","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099571","volume":"9"},

Streams and other water bodies are central habitats in the ecology of the disease, particularly in rainforests where they may transport and transmit the pathogen and harbor infected tadpoles that serve as reservoir hosts. We conducted an experiment using larval green-eyed tree frogs Litoria serrata in semi-natural streamside channels to test the hypotheses that (1) the fungus can be transmitted downstream in stream habitats and (2) infection affects tadpole growth and mouthpart loss. Our results showed that transmission can occur downstream in flowing water with no contact between individuals, that newly infected tadpoles suffered increased mouthpart loss in comparison with controls that were never infected and that infected tadpoles grew at reduced rates. Although recently infected tadpoles showed substantial loss of mouthparts, individuals with longstanding infections did not, suggesting that mouthparts may re-grow following initial loss. Our study suggests that any management efforts that can reduce the prevalence of infections in tadpoles may be particularly effective if applied in headwater areas, as their effects are likely to be felt downstream.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hagman","given":"Mattias"},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."}],"citation-key":"hagman2015","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","container-title-short":"Dis.

We used Bayesian analysis of shared frailty models to examine survival of adult females of the giant gartersnake (Thamnophis gigas) in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA, and to examine the effects of individual and habitat characteristics on daily risk of mortality. Posterior mean annual survival probability of adult females was 0.61 [95% credible interval (CI) = 0.41–0.79]. The daily risk of mortality for adult female giant gartersnakes while in terrestrial habitats was 0.38 (0.09–0.89) times as great as when they inhabited aquatic habitats. Although 95% CIs for hazard ratios of other covariates included one, sites varied substantially in the effect of linear habitats, which appear to have context-dependent effects on survival.

  {"id":"harding2016","abstract":"Captive breeding and reintroduction remain high profile but controversial conservation interventions. It is important to understand how such programs develop and respond to strategic conservation initiatives. We analyzed the contribution to conservation made by amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction since the launch of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP) in 2007. We assembled data on amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction from a variety of sources including the Amphibian Ark database and the IUCN Red List. We also carried out systematic searches of Web of Science, JSTOR, and Google Scholar for relevant literature. Relative to data collected from 1966 to 2006, the number of species involved in captive breeding and reintroduction projects increased by 57% in the 7 years since release of the ACAP. However, there have been relatively few new reintroductions over this period; most programs have focused on securing captive-assurance populations (i.e., species taken into captivity as a precaution against extinctions in the wild) and conservation-related research. There has been a shift to a broader representation of frogs, salamanders, and caecilians within programs and an increasing emphasis on threatened species. There has been a relative increase of species in programs from Central and South America and the Caribbean, where amphibian biodiversity is high. About half of the programs involve zoos and aquaria with a similar proportion represented in specialist facilities run by governmental or nongovernmental agencies. Despite successful reintroduction often being regarded as the ultimate milestone for such programs, the irreversibility of many current threats to amphibians may make this an impractical goal. Instead, research on captive assurance populations may be needed to develop imaginative solutions to enable amphibians to survive alongside current, emerging, and future threats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Harding","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Pavajeau","given":"Lissette"}],"citation-key":"harding2016","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12612","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4]]},"language":"en","page":"340-349","source":"Crossref","title":"Developments in amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction program","title-short":"Developments in amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12612","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"harjoe2022","abstract":"Pathogens can alter species composition and ecosystem function by causing direct and indirect effects on communities. Zoospores of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter, Bd), a pathogen implicated in worldwide amphibian declines, can be consumed by filter-feeding zooplankton and can damage mouthparts of infected amphibian larvae. Consequently, we hypothesized that this pathogen would affect the abundance of zooplankton and survival and feeding abilities of larval amphibian hosts. In turn, this could affect the algal food resources of zooplankton and tadpoles, which can include phytoplankton and periphyton. We tested these hypotheses by manipulating the presence of western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) larvae and Bd in outdoor mesocosms and quantifying the densities of amphibians, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and periphyton. Bd infections reduced amphibian larval densities, but this only weakly benefitted periphyton (a density-mediated indirect effect). After controlling for larval densities, mesocosms with Bd-exposed larvae had significantly more periphyton biomass than mesocosms with larvae but no Bd, consistent with infection-induced mouthpart damage reducing larval feeding rates on attached algae (a trait-mediated indirect effect). In fact, the estimated trait-mediated effect of Bd on periphyton biomass was larger than the densitymediated effect. However, we did not find evidence that Bd exposure triggered a switch to filter-feeding phytoplankton. The presence of Bd was associated with increased copepod abundance, consistent with zooplankton consuming chytrid zoospores. These results suggest that Bd has the potential to cause both trait- and density-mediated indirect effects that can alter community composition and perhaps the primary productivity of freshwater ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Harjoe","given":"Carmen C."},{"family":"Buck","given":"Julia C."},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Claire E."},{"family":"Olson","given":"Deanna H."},{"family":"Blaustein","given":"Andrew R."}],"citation-key":"harjoe2022","container-title":"Ecosphere","container-title-short":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.4043","ISSN":"2150-8925, 2150-8925","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pathogenic fungus causes density‐ and trait‐mediated trophic cascades in an aquatic community","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.4043","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"harris2009","abstract":"Background: While religious faith remains one of the most significant features of human life, little is known about its relationship to ordinary belief at the level of the brain. Nor is it known whether religious believers and nonbelievers differ in how they evaluate statements of fact. Our lab previously has used functional neuroimaging to study belief as a general mode of cognition [1], and others have looked specifically at religious belief [2]. However, no research has compared these two states of mind directly.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure signal changes in the brains of thirty subjects—fifteen committed Christians and fifteen nonbelievers—as they evaluated the truth and falsity of religious and nonreligious propositions. For both groups, and in both categories of stimuli, belief (judgments of ‘‘true’’ vs judgments of ‘‘false’’) was associated with greater signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area important for selfrepresentation [3,4,5,6], emotional associations [7], reward [8,9,10], and goal-driven behavior [11]. This region showed greater signal whether subjects believed statements about God, the Virgin Birth, etc. or statements about ordinary facts. A comparison of both stimulus categories suggests that religious thinking is more associated with brain regions that govern emotion, self-representation, and cognitive conflict, while thinking about ordinary facts is more reliant upon memory retrieval networks.\nConclusions/Significance: While religious and nonreligious thinking differentially engage broad regions of the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobes, the difference between belief and disbelief appears to be content-independent. Our study compares religious thinking with ordinary cognition and, as such, constitutes a step toward developing a neuropsychology of religion. However, these findings may also further our understanding of how the brain accepts statements of all kinds to be valid descriptions of the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Jonas T."},{"family":"Curiel","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Bookheimer","given":"Susan Y."},{"family":"Iacoboni","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Mark S."}],"citation-key":"harris2009","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0007272","editor":[{"family":"Sporns","given":"Olaf"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e7272","source":"Crossref","title":"The neural correlates of religious and nonreligious belief","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007272","volume":"4"},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Xavier A."},{"family":"Donaldson","given":"Lynda"},{"family":"Correa-Cano","given":"Maria Eugenia"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"David N."},{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Cecily E.D."},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Beth S."},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"David J."},{"family":"Inger","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"harrison2018","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4794","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,23]]},"language":"en","page":"e4794","source":"Crossref","title":"A brief introduction to mixed effects modelling and multi-model inference in ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4794","volume":"6"},

We conducted a genetic study of the cryptic and threatened alpine she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus praealtus) throughout its range, across two regions of the mainland Australian Alps; an extensive high elevation plateau in the north (‘Kosciuszko Plateau’) and several smaller plateaus in the south (‘southern plateaus’). We investigated whether extensive potential habitat across Kosciuszko Plateau supported larger, connected populations with better genetic health than more fragmented southern plateaus. Our analyses of genome-wide markers confirmed effective isolation of the two regions. We identified three populations from the southern plateaus, largely aligning with discrete landforms, and four populations on Kosciuszko Plateau. Only one individual, from the southern-most population, showed evidence of admixture between the two regions. Across its range, C. praealtus populations had low genetic diversity and small effective population sizes. In contrast to our expectations, Kosciuszko Plateau populations were smaller, with greater genetic differentiation and a higher degree of inbreeding than the southern populations. We detected admixture between populations on Kosciuszko Plateau, while the southern plateaus had limited admixture. We found no evidence of local adaptation, suggesting plateaus represent interglacial refugia. Our results suggest that C. praealtus has little capacity to withstand further disturbance or rapid environmental changes. Maintaining or restoring habitat quality in occupied and suitable connecting habitats across the species’ range is paramount. ‘Genetic rescue’ should be investigated as an option to mitigate the effects of isolation and improve population resilience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartley","given":"Renée"},{"family":"Clemann","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Atkins","given":"Zak"},{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Lindenmayer","given":"David B."},{"family":"Amor","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"hartley2023","container-title":"Conservation Genetics","container-title-short":"Conserv Genet","DOI":"10.1007/s10592-022-01495-x","ISSN":"1566-0621, 1572-9737","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"219-233","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Isolated on sky islands: genetic diversity and population structure of an endangered mountain lizard","title-short":"Isolated on sky islands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10592-022-01495-x","volume":"24"},

Because fewer locations are likely to be suitable, hibernation site availability may restrict the northern distribution of snakes. We considered overwinter mortality, hibernation site fidelity, and the abundance of suitable hibernation sites based on surface features to assess whether Massasauga Rattlesnakes are likely to be limited by hibernation site availability on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario, Canada. We used three years of radio telemetry to locate 46 hibernation sites of 32 individual snakes. Snakes hibernated individually in old root systems, rodent burrows, and rock crevices in forested areas. Hibernation sites could be differentiated from forested areas generally available to snakes but not from locations with holes and crevices in the immediate vicinity of hibernation sites. Few snakes hibernated in the same location in consecutive years, although most (>70%) hibernated within 100 m of their previous location. Overwinter mortality over three years (23%) was similar to mortality during the active season (21%). Our results suggest that Massasauga Rattlesnakes may be limited by the availability of suitable hibernation sites, but sites of similar quality to those used by overwintering snakes are locally abundant. The location of hibernation sites within forests could not be predicted reliably based on surface features. Therefore, efforts to conserve habitat for this threatened species should consider all forested areas on the Bruce Peninsula as potential hibernation habitat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Harvey","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Weatherhead","given":"Patrick J."}],"citation-key":"harvey2006","container-title":"Journal of Herpetology","container-title-short":"hpet","DOI":"10.1670/89-05A.1","ISSN":"0022-1511, 1937-2418","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3]]},"page":"66-73","publisher":"Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles","source":"bioone.org","title":"Hibernation site selection by eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (<i>Sistrurus catenatus catenatus</i>) near their northern range limit","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-herpetology/volume-40/issue-1/89-05A.1/Hibernation-Site-Selection-by-Eastern-Massasauga-Rattlesnakes-Sistrurus-catenatus-catenatus/10.1670/89-05A.1.full","volume":"40"},

Managing reservoirs of multihost pathogens often plays a crucial role in effective disease control. However, reservoirs remain variously and loosely defined. We propose that reservoirs can only be understood with reference to defined target populations. Therefore, we define a reservoir as one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population. Existence of a reservoir is confirmed when infection within the target population cannot be sustained after all transmission between target and nontarget populations has been eliminated. When disease can be controlled solely by interventions within target populations, little knowledge of potentially complex reservoir infection dynamics is necessary for effective control.

We analysed repeated site-survey data for adults and larvae of the growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in order to estimate probabilities of detection for the species using alternative survey techniques. The estimated probability of detecting adults of L. raniformis at occupied sites using diurnal searches was much less than 1.0 (0.107; 95% credible interval: 0.045, 0.192). The estimated probability of detecting adults using nocturnal spotlight searches was considerably higher, but still less than 1.0 (0.696; 95% credible interval: 0.585, 0.796). These results indicate that nocturnal searches are a much more efficient and reliable means of detecting the presence of adult L. raniformis than diurnal searches, but detection using either technique is less than certain. The probability of detecting tadpoles of L. raniformis using either funnel-trapping or dip-netting techniques was estimated at 0.350 (95% credible interval: 0.151, 0.567). Together, these results indicate that reliance on singlesite visits during surveys for this species is likely to result in severe under-estimation of the proportion of sites that are actually occupied.

  {"id":"heard2008","abstract":"The removal of toes in unique combinations (‘toe-clipping’) has historically been the most popular technique for individually marking amphibians. However, recent studies have questioned the utility and ethics of this technique, and provided impetus for research on the efﬁcacy of alternative methods. In this study, the efﬁcacy of Visible Implant Alphanumeric (VIA) tags for marking juvenile growling grass frogs (Litoria raniformis) was assessed with reference to the fundamental assumptions of the mark–recapture approach. Three questions were investigated: (1) What is the probability of tag loss? (2) What is the probability of tag misidentiﬁcation, and does it vary between frogs or observers, or with observer experience? and (3) To what extent does tagging inﬂuence survival or growth? Laboratory and ﬁeld trials demonstrated that the probability of tag loss for juvenile L. raniformis was ~0.07 (95% CI: 0.03–0.13) when tags where implanted on the dorsolateral region of the thorax, eight times lower than that estimated for tags implanted on the thigh (mean 0.59; 95% CI: 0.29–0.86). Tags were rarely misidentiﬁed by naïve observers (mean probability of tag misidentiﬁcation <0.01), but tag read accuracy varied amongst observers.

  {"id":"heard2012","abstract":"A popular idea amongst ecologists last century was that animals which exploit dynamic environments often display ‘fast’ life history strategies (high fecundity, rapid growth and maturation, and low or variable adult survival rates) relative to those which occupy more stable environments. Whilst the underlying theory has been discredited, the categorization remains of interest, because species with ‘fast’ life history traits are thought to be more robust to human-induced environmental change than those with ‘slow’ life history traits.We examined the life history traits of the endangered Australian frog Litoria raniformis, to determine whether it displays ‘fast’ life history traits (like its sister species L. aurea and L. castanea), and to assess the role of these traits in the decline of this species. Mark-recapture data conﬁrmed that L. raniformis displays rapid growth and maturation. The data also suggest that L. raniformis displays relatively low adult survival rates. We propose that the ‘fast’ life history traits of this species are adaptive to metapopulation dynamics. In turn, we suggest that the rapid decline of L. raniformis may have resulted from metapopulation collapse, driven ultimately by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and proximately by severe stochastic perturbations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey W."},{"family":"Scroggie","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Malone","given":"Brian S."}],"citation-key":"heard2012","container-title":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02275.x","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4]]},"language":"en","page":"276-284","source":"Crossref","title":"The life history and decline of the threatened Australian frog, <i>Litoria raniformis</i>","title-short":"The life history and decline of the threatened Australian frog, Litoria raniformis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02275.x","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"heard2014","abstract":"Identifying determinants of the probability and intensity of infections is important for understanding the epidemiology of wildlife diseases, and for managing their impact on threatened species. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has decimated populations of some amphibians. However, recent studies have identiﬁed important environmental constraints on the disease, related to the pathogen’s physiological tolerances. In this study, we identiﬁed several intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of the probability and intensity of chytrid infections for the threatened growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in southeastern Australia, and used mark–recapture to estimate the effect of chytrid infections on the probability of survival of these frogs. Water temperature and salinity had negative effects on both the probability and intensity of chytrid infections. We coupled models of the infection process with a model of the effect of chytrid infections on the probability of survival to assess variation in the impact of chytridiomycosis between wetlands with differing temperature and salinity proﬁles. Our results suggest that warm, saline wetlands may be refuges from chytridiomycosis for L. raniformis, and should be priorities for protection. Our results also suggest that management actions that increase water temperature (e.g., reducing canopy shading) and salinity (e.g., complementing inﬂows with groundwater) could be trialed to reduce the impacts of chytridiomycosis on this species. This and other recent studies highlight the value of research on environmental risk factors for chytridiomycosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey W."},{"family":"Scroggie","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Clemann","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Ramsey","given":"David S.

Yet epidemiological theory for metapopulations has largely overlooked the capacity of particular patches to act as refuges from disease, and has suggested that connectivity can undermine persistence. Here, we show that relatively warm and saline wetlands are environmental refuges from chytridiomycosis for an endangered Australian frog, and act jointly with connectivity to sustain frog metapopulations. We coupled models of microclimate and infection probability to map chytrid prevalence, and demonstrate a strong negative relationship between chytrid prevalence and the persistence of frog populations. Simulations conﬁrm that frog metapopulations are likely to go extinct when they lack environmental refuges from disease and lose connectivity between patches.

Our modeling revealed that: (1) habitat management is most effective in climates where hosts are already less susceptible to the disease; (2) creating habitat, particularly habitat with refugial properties adverse to the pathogen, may be substantially more effective than manipulating existing habitat; and (3) increasing metapopulation size and connectivity through strategic habitat creation can greatly reduce extinction risk.

  {"id":"hector2019","abstract":"As a result of global climate change, species are experiencing an escalation in the severity and regularity of extreme thermal events. With patterns of disease distribution and transmission predicted to undergo considerable shifts in the coming years, the interplay between temperature and pathogen exposure will likely determine the capacity of a population to persist under the dual threat of global change and infectious disease. In this study, we investigated how exposure to a pathogen affects an individual's ability to cope with extreme temperatures. Using experimental infections of Daphnia magna with its obligate bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa, we measured upper thermal limits of multiple host and pathogen genotype combinations across the dynamic process of infection and under various forms (static and ramping) of thermal stress. We find that pathogens substantially limit the thermal tolerance of their host, with the reduction in upper thermal limits on par with the breadth of variation seen across similar species entire geographical ranges. The precise magnitude of any reduction, however, was specific to the host and pathogen genotype combination. In addition, as thermal ramping rate slowed, upper thermal limits of both healthy and infected individuals were reduced. Our results suggest that the capacity of a population to evolve new thermal limits, when also faced with the threat of infection, will depend not only on a host's genetic variability in warmer environments, but also on the frequency of host and pathogen genotypes. We suggest that pathogen‐induced alterations of host thermal performance should be taken into account when assessing the resilience of any population and its potential for adaptation to global change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hector","given":"Tobias E."},{"family":"Sgrò","given":"Carla M."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Matthew D."}],"citation-key":"hector2019","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.14713","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,31]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Pathogen exposure disrupts an organism's ability to cope with thermal stress","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14713"},

Consequently, there is an increasing use of meta-analytic methods to combine evidence from studies that estimate the parameters of structural equation models. Two approaches are used to combine evidence from structural equation models: A direct approach that combines structural coefficients and an indirect approach that first combines correlation matrices and estimates structural coefficients from the combined correlation matrix. When there is no heterogeneity across studies, direct estimates of structural coefficients from several studies is an appealing approach. Heterogeneity of correlation matrices across studies presents both practical and conceptual problems.

However, appropriate methods to account for size-dependent demographic changes are needed, especially in understudied yet threatened groups such as amphibians. We investigated individual- and population-level demographic effects of changes in body size for a terrestrial salamander using capture–mark–recapture data. For our analysis, we implemented an integral projection model parameterized with capture–recapture likelihood estimates from a Bayesian framework. Our study combines survival and growth data from a single dataset to quantify the influence of size on survival while including different sources of uncertainty around these parameters, demonstrating how selective forces can be studied in populations with limited data and incomplete recaptures. We found a strong dependency of the population growth rate on changes in individual size, mediated by potential changes in selection on mean body size and on maximum body size. Our approach of simultaneous parameter estimation can be extended across taxa to identify eco-evolutionary mechanisms acting on size-specific vital rates, and thus shaping population dynamics and viability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hernández-Pacheco","given":"Raisa"},{"family":"Plard","given":"Floriane"},{"family":"Grayson","given":"Kristine L."},{"family":"Steiner","given":"Ulrich K."}],"citation-key":"hernandez-pacheco2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.6988","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"174-185","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Demographic consequences of changing body size in a terrestrial salamander","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6988","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"hero2004","abstract":"Amphibian declines have been reported from around the world. Here we examine life history and distributional characteristics of Australian frogs listed as threatened under the IUCN Global Amphibian Assessment guidelines, and compare these results to available information on threatened amphibians around the world. Forty of 213 Australian frog species (18.8%) are currently recognised as threatened. While eight species are listed as Vulnerable due to small or restricted populations alone (VU D2), the remaining 32 species are associated with population declines. Threatened species are concentrated in upland areas (41% of all upland species are threatened, while only 8% of lowland species are threatened). Twenty-eight of the 40 threatened species (70%) primarily occur in upland areas while only 42 of the 173 non-threatened species (24.3%) occur in upland areas. Restricted geographic range is characteristic of 31 of 40 threatened/declining species (77.5%). However, 41 non-threatened species (23.7%) also have restricted geographic ranges. Latitudinal position is not strongly associated with the degree of threat. Threatened species are strongly associated with specific reproductive habitats: 80% of species occurring in montane wetlands and 58% of species breeding in wet forest streams are threatened. For 22 of the 40 (55%) threatened species, known threats do not adequately explain the extent of decline. Habitat modification is the foremost threatening process associated with declines in 20 of the 40 threatened species (50%), including 11 of 12 threatened lowland species (91.7%). Chytrid fungus is notably associated with declines for five species and a potential contributor for an additional nine species (35% of threatened species). However, the chytrid has also been detected in an additional 33 non-threatened species (19%). Minor threats associated with threatened species include fire and global changes in weather patterns. Phylogenetic relationships of Australian frogs are poorly resolved, and there are no strong associations between phylogeny and declines within known taxonomic groups. A notable exception are frogs of the myobatrachid genus Taudactylus where five of the six species are threatened. Global patterns are difficult to assess, however, as declines are strongly associated with species that are primarily distributed in upland areas. Chytrid fungus has been found in both declining and nondeclining species throughout Australia, and while its role as an emerging infectious disease is currently under investigation (in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, Costa Rica, Ecuador and the USA), little is known about its distribution and prevalence in other countries.","author":[{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Morrison","given":"Clare"}],"citation-key":"hero2004","container-title":"Herpetological Journal","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"175-186","source":"Zotero","title":"Frog declines in Australia: global implications","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"hero2005","abstract":"Catastrophic declines of amphibian populations have been reported from upland areas around the world, yet within regions not all species have been affected. Herein, we examine the relationships between conservation status and ecological traits for over 60 amphibian species from upland areas of eastern Australia. Among the 24 phylogenetic groups examined, eight groups contained only declining species, eight groups contained both declining and nondeclining species and eight groups had no declining species, suggesting species declines are inﬂuenced by their evolutionary history. Declines have been reported for only one species (Philoria frosti) of 20 species (i.e. from genera Assa, Cophixalus, Austrochaperina and remaining Philoria/Kyaranus) with direct development in the terrestrial environment. Of the remaining 40 species that include an aquatic stage in the life history, species-speciﬁc traits associated with declines suggest species with stream-dwelling tadpoles are more likely to be declining than species that breed in ephemeral and isolated ponds. However, low ovarian clutch size is the most important ecological trait signiﬁcantly associated with the tendency for a species to be declining (independent of phylogeny). Species with restricted geographic ranges are also more likely to be declining than widespread species (independent of phylogeny). While ovarian clutch size and geographic range are correlated they are both good predictors for the likelihood of decline for upland species independent of their phylogenetic history. We propose that low ovarian clutch size is an index of low fecundity, and indicates a reduction in population resilience, making those species more susceptible to population declines and extinction than highly fecund species. This provides the ﬁrst ecological explanation for why some species are declining while other sympatric species are not. Geographic range provides an easily applied tool that can be used to predict the likelihood of species decline in other regions. These results support the hypothesis that a causal factor may be affecting all species of frogs, yet only those species with naturally low population resilience are susceptible to declines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Stephen E."},{"family":"Magnusson","given":"William E."}],"citation-key":"hero2005","container-title":"Journal of Zoology","DOI":"10.1017/S0952836905007296","ISSN":"0952-8369, 1469-7998","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10,18]]},"language":"en","page":"221-232","source":"Crossref","title":"Ecological traits of declining amphibians in upland areas of eastern Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1017/S0952836905007296","volume":"267"},

  {"id":"hettyey2019","abstract":"Understanding how animal behavior can inﬂuence the susceptibility of endangered hosts to emerging pathogens and using this knowledge to ameliorate negative effects of infectious wildlife diseases is a promising avenue in conservation biology. Chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in amphibians has led to the most spectacular disease-borne loss of vertebrate biodiversity ever recorded in history. Unfortunately, the methods of mitigation that are available today are only practical in captive populations, and an effective method that could be applied in natural habitats without inﬂicting vast collateral damage is lacking. We suggest here that the thermal tolerance mismatch between Bd and its ectothermic hosts coupled with the thermoregulatory behavior of amphibians could be exploited in mitigation interventions combating Bd infection in situ. If microhabitats with elevated temperatures are made available in their natural environment, individuals taking advantage of the possibility to reach their preferred body temperature could critically lower their infection intensity or even clear the pathogen. We provide a basis for studying this approach by reviewing the evidence that supports the idea, describing how technical difﬁculties may be overcome, pointing out gaps in our knowledge that need to be ﬁlled by future studies, and listing presumable beneﬁts and probable limitations of localized heating. The proposed approach has good potential to become an effective in situ mitigation method that can be easily employed in a wide taxonomic range of amphibians, especially in species that are warm-adapted, while causing less collateral damage than any other method that is currently available. If so, it may quickly become a widely applicable tool of biodiversity conservation and may contribute to saving many amphibian populations and species from extinction in the next few decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hettyey","given":"Attila"},{"family":"Ujszegi","given":"János"},{"family":"Herczeg","given":"Dávid"},{"family":"Holly","given":"Dóra"},{"family":"Vörös","given":"Judit"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Benedikt R."},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Jaime"}],"citation-key":"hettyey2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.3389/fevo.2019.00254","ISSN":"2296-701X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,3]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Mitigating disease impacts in amphibian populations: Capitalizing on the thermal optimum mismatch between a pathogen and its host","title-short":"Mitigating Disease Impacts in Amphibian Populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2019.00254/full","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"hines1999","abstract":"In May 1997, the National Threatened Frog Working Group recognised a need to bring together specialists in research, management and policy making to discuss their understanding of the continuing declines to our frog fauna and to prioritise future action for addressing the issue. As a result a two day 'National Threatened Frog Workshop' was held at the University of Canberra in November 1997 sponsored by Environment Australia, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the University of Canberra and the Worldwide Fund for Nature.The Workshop brought together some 80 people from throughout Australia and overseas involved in frog research, management and policy development and included representatives from government agencies, educational institutions and non-government organisations. The purpose of the Workshop was to: 1. provide an overview of the current status of knowledge about species which are declining; 2. provide an overview of what's known about the decline and how it is being tackled; 3. identify gaps in knowledge; 4. recommend priorities for notional effort for research, management and community attention; 5. help set future priority actions for the Working Group; and 6. establish on-going communication links between all participants and the wider community. Following the Workshop the Working Group met and emphasised: the need to maintain a broad perspective and to continue monitoring and research on a range of possible causal factors; the need to support research into new areas - particularly disease as a potentially major factor influencing global declines; the need to support strategic research and to develop protocols to address this issue; and the need to support research on fluctuating asymmetry as a possible early warning tool for predicting declines. They also requested that the workshop proceedings be published; that a brochure on declining frogs be prepared; that a web site to provide up to date information about declining frog issues be established and that a national but restricted internet discussion group on frogs should be established.y, it.","author":[{"family":"Hines","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"hines1999","container-title":"Declines and disappearances of Australian frogs","editor":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Alastair"}],"event-place":"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","ISBN":"978-0-642-54656-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 44894378","page":"44-63","publisher":"Biodiversity Group, Environment Australia","publisher-place":"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"An assessment of frog declines in wet subtropical Australia","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"hocking2013","abstract":"Successful multi-use planning for forested landscapes requires an understanding of timber management effects on wildlife species. Lungless, woodland salamanders depend on forested habitats and are sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture associated with many forestry practices. Additionally, woodland salamanders are territorial and have relatively low vagility, making it unlikely that they can successfully migrate to more favorable habitat when the surrounding forest is harvested. Therefore, we examined the abundance of the Western Slimy Salamander, Plethodon albagula, in an experimentally manipulated forest in central Missouri. We used artiﬁcial cover object searches to compare salamander abundance in three replicate treatments that were clear-cut then burned to reduce maple regeneration, clear-cut and not burned, partially harvested, and un-manipulated control forest. We captured a total of 300 Western Slimy Salamanders between April 2007 and September 2011. We found signiﬁcantly fewer salamanders in the burn and clear-cut treatments compared with the partial and control treatments. We also found a lower proportion of juveniles and had fewer recaptures in the burn and clear-cut than in the partial and control treatments. Consistent with other studies of woodland salamanders, our results suggest that for at least the ﬁrst 7 years post-harvest, clear-cutting is detrimental to woodland salamander populations. This initial reduction in abundance combined with the further reduced proportion of juveniles may have longer lasting effects even as the forest regenerates. Finally, it appears that timber harvest resulting in limited canopy thinning may be compatible with maintaining populations of Western Slimy Salamanders in Missouri.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hocking","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Connette","given":"Grant M."},{"family":"Conner","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Scheffers","given":"Brett R."},{"family":"Pittman","given":"Shannon E."},{"family":"Peterman","given":"William E."},{"family":"Semlitsch","given":"Raymond D."}],"citation-key":"hocking2013","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2012.09.013","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1]]},"language":"en","page":"32-39","source":"Crossref","title":"Effects of experimental forest management on a terrestrial, woodland salamander in Missouri","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112712005476","volume":"287"},

This is troubling, since we have a large body of correlations between brain activity and consciousness, correlations normally assumed to entail that brain activity creates conscious experience. Here I explore a solution to the mind-body problem that starts with the converse assumption: these correlations arise because consciousness creates brain activity, and indeed creates all objects and properties of the physical world. To this end, I develop two theses. The multimodal user interface theory of perception states that perceptual experiences do not match or approximate properties of the objective world, but instead provide a simpliﬁed, species-speciﬁc, user interface to that world. Conscious realism states that the objective world consists of conscious agents and their experiences; these can be mathematically modeled and empirically explored in the normal scientiﬁc manner.","author":[{"family":"Hoﬀman","given":"Donald D."}],"citation-key":"hoffman2008","container-title":"Mind & Matter","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"87-121","source":"Zotero","title":"Conscious realism and the mind-body problem","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"hoffman2014","abstract":"Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.","author":[{"family":"Hoﬀman","given":"Matthew D"},{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"hoffman2014","container-title":"Journal of Machine Learning Research","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"1593-1623","source":"Zotero","title":"The No-U-Turn Sampler: Adaptively setting path lengths in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

This is especially true for amphibians, which are disappearing at an alarming rate. The emerging fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), causes the skin disease chytridiomycosis and is a major contributor to amphibian population declines. Recent studies suggest that symbiotic skin bacteria provide some protection against Bd. Possible mitigation strategies include skin microbiome manipulation and bioaugmentation with potentially beneﬁcial bacteria. Such approaches may employ a method to reduce resident bacteria on the skin to allow for new colonization. Using the southern leopard frog, Rana (Lithobates) sphenocephala, we show here that the skin of this species harbors a rich array of culturable bacterial species that inhibit Bd growth in vitro. Use of a potent antibiotic cocktail dramatically reduced culturable skin bacteria within 48 h. Reduction of bacteria on post-metamorphic juvenile skin using this antibiotic cocktail resulted in an increased Bd skin burden within two weeks of Bd exposure and a higher Bd burden in those frogs that died. However, efforts to maintain a normal bacterial skin community using a semi-natural mesocosm-derived source of microbes failed to provide long term protection of these vulnerable frogs. Regardless of presence or absence of mesocosm-derived bacteria, Bd loads decreased over time in surviving frogs, suggesting the development of an adaptive immune defense. In this species, development of an antimicrobial peptide defense is delayed, and thus, the microbial community and adaptive immune defenses may provide protection at this critical period of development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Holden","given":"Whitney M."},{"family":"Hanlon","given":"Shane M."},{"family":"Woodhams","given":"Douglas C."},{"family":"Chappell","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Wells","given":"Heather L."},{"family":"Glisson","given":"Samantha M."},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"Valerie J."},{"family":"Knight","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Parris","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Rollins-Smith","given":"Louise A."}],"citation-key":"holden2015a","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.007","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"language":"en","page":"91-102","source":"Crossref","title":"Skin bacteria provide early protection for newly metamorphosed southern leopard frogs (<i>Rana <span class=\"nocase\">sphenocephala</span></i>) against the frog-killing fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320715001524","volume":"187"},

  {"id":"hollanders2022c","abstract":"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are broadly applicable hierarchical models that derive their utility from separating state processes from observation processes yielding the data. Multistate models such as mark–recapture and dynamic multistate occupancy models are HMMs frequently used in ecology. In their early formulations, states, such as pathogen infection status, were assumed to be perfectly observed without ambiguity. However, state uncertainty is a pervasive feature of many ecological studies, and multievent models were developed to explicitly account for it. We developed a novel extended multievent mark–recapture model that incorporates state uncertainty at multiple levels of detection. Using a disease-structured example, both false negative and false positive state assignment errors are modelled at two levels of state assignment—the pathogen sampling process and the diagnostic process that samples are subjected to. We additionally describe methods to jointly model infection intensity to integrate heterogeneity in ecological parameters, such as mortality and infection dynamics, and the pathogen detection processes. We provide code to simulate and analyse datasets with various underlying ecological processes and fit our model to a mark–recapture dataset of Mixophyes fleayi (Fleay's barred frog) infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd). In our case study, we found evidence for various state assignment errors: the sampling protocol performed poorly in detecting Bd, pathogen detection was highly dependent on infection intensity and false positives were non-negligible. Incorporating state uncertainty yielded significantly higher estimates of infection prevalence and 4–5 times lower rates of infection state transitions compared to those obtained from a traditional multistate model. Our results highlight that incorporating state assignment errors improves inference on the ecological process, especially when sensitivity and specificity of the state assignment processes are low. The general model structure can be applied to other HMMs, providing a foundation for modelling state uncertainty in related models. For disease-structured multistate models, we recommend conducting robust design surveys and collecting samples during each capture event to facilitate incorporating pathogen detection errors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hollanders","given":"Matthijs"},{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

Host life stage is an important consideration and many studies have highlighted the vulnerability of recently metamorphosed or juvenile frogs compared to adults. The majority of these studies have taken place in a laboratory setting, and there is a general paucity of longitudinal field studies investigating the influence of life stage on disease outcome. In this study, we assessed the effect of endemic Bd on juvenile Mixophyes fleayi (Fleay’s barred frog) in subtropical eastern Australian rainforest. Using photographic mark-recapture, we made 386 captures of 116 individuals and investigated the effect of Bd infection intensity on the apparent mortality rates of frogs using a multievent model correcting for infection state misclassification. We found that neither Bd infection status nor infection intensity predicted mortality in juvenile frogs, counter to the expectation that early life stages are more vulnerable to disease, despite average high infection prevalence (0.35, 95% HDPI [0.14, 0.52]). Additionally, we found that observed infection prevalence and intensity were somewhat lower for juveniles than adults. Our results indicate that in this Bd-recovered species, the realized impacts of chytridiomycosis on juveniles were apparently low, likely resulting in high recruitment contributing to population stability.

  {"id":"hooten2015","abstract":"The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly ﬁnd that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different ﬁelds. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it speciﬁcally for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hooten","given":"M.

Exposure in mesocosms to a nominal concentration of 1?mg/L (measured concentrations at 1?h and 24?h postaddition of 0.160?mg/L and 0.062?mg/L, respectively), a realistic direct-overspray scenario, reduced survival to metamorphosis by 43% relative to controls and revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Survival ranged from 74% for the most tolerant population to 18% for the least tolerant population, a 4.1-fold difference. Mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis were unaffected. Although malathion reduced zooplankton abundance, it did not alter food resources (periphyton or phytoplankton relative abundance), or a suite of water-quality variables (pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen). A 96-h time-to-death assay designed to isolate direct, lethal effects also revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Time to death (mean?±?standard error) ranged from 2.4?±?0.18?h for the least tolerant population to 17.8?±?4.72?h for the most tolerant population, a 7.4-fold difference. However, relative sensitivities of populations differed in the mesocosm and laboratory studies, which differed in exposure concentrations, suggesting that populations tolerant of high concentrations can be more sensitive to lower concentrations. We suggest that direct overspray could reduce larval survival in the field for this species. Studies assessing the role of contaminants in declines or extrapolating to untested populations, especially across large geographical regions, should quantify the range of intraspecific variation. Risk assessors could address intraspecific variability directly by using an intraspecific uncertainty factor.

We tested hypotheses that 1) atrazine addition increases the prevalence and intensity of testicular ova (TO) among phenotypic males at metamorphosis and after overwintering, 2) atrazine reduces maturation of ova after overwintering among phenotypic females, and 3) atrazine alters mass, time, and survival to metamorphosis, as well as growth and survival across terrestrial life stages. Atrazine addition increased probability of TO presence at metamorphosis, but only when treatments were pooled and compared to the control, where background atrazine was detected. Atrazine did not influence the intensity of TO among metamorphs. We observed TO among males at spring emergence and at reproductive age regardless of exposure concentration. We found no evidence for effects of exposure on gonadal maturation among females after overwintering. Exposure to 200 μg/L reduced survival to metamorphosis, but atrazine did not affect mass at metamorphosis, time to metamorphosis, or survival or mass after overwintering. We demonstrate that atrazine addition can increase TO prevalence relative to background rates at metamorphosis and that TO are also present among phenotypic males after overwintering.

We compared pre- and post-fire counts of tadpoles in eight streams in northwestern Montana to determine the effects of wildfire on A. montanus. All streams were initially sampled in 2001, 2 years before four of them burned in a large wildfire, and were resampled during the 2 years following the fire. Counts of tadpoles were similar in the two groups of streams before the fire. After the fire, tadpoles were almost twice as abundant in unburned streams than in burned streams. The fire seemed to have the greatest negative effect on abundance of age-1 tadpoles, which was reflected in the greater variation in same-stream age-class structure compared with those in unburned streams. Despite the apparent effect on tadpoles, we do not expect the wildfire to be an extirpation threat to populations in the streams that we sampled. Studies spanning a chronosequence of fires, as well as in other areas, are needed to assess the effects of fires on streams with A. montanus and to determine the severity and persistence of these effects.

We evaluated the effects of a large, stand-replacement wildﬁre on three species of pond-breeding amphibians by estimating changes in occupancy of breeding sites during the three years before and after the ﬁre burned 42 of 83 previously surveyed wetlands. Annual occupancy and colonization for each species was estimated using recently developed models that incorporate detection probabilities to provide unbiased parameter estimates. We did not ﬁnd negative effects of the ﬁre on the occupancy or colonization rates of the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum). Instead, its occupancy was higher across the study area after the ﬁre, possibly in response to a large snowpack that may have facilitated colonization of unoccupied wetlands. Naı¨ ve data (uncorrected for detection probability) for the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) initially led to the conclusion of increased occupancy and colonization in wetlands that burned. After accounting for temporal and spatial variation in detection probabilities, however, it was evident that these parameters were relatively stable in both areas before and after the ﬁre. We found a similar discrepancy between naı¨ ve and estimated occupancy of A. macrodactylum that resulted from different detection probabilities in burned and control wetlands. The boreal toad (Bufo boreas) was not found breeding in the area prior to the ﬁre but colonized several wetlands the year after they burned. Occupancy by B. boreas then declined during years 2 and 3 following the ﬁre. Our study suggests that the amphibian populations we studied are resistant to wildﬁre and that B. boreas may experience short-term beneﬁts from wildﬁre.

  {"id":"hossack2009","abstract":"Disturbance has long been a central issue in amphibian conservation, often regarding negative effects of logging or other forest management activities, but some amphibians seem to prefer disturbed habitats. After documenting increased use of recently burned forests by boreal toads (Bufo boreas), we hypothesized that burned habitats provided improved thermal opportunities in terrestrial habitats. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a radio telemetry study of habitat use (reported previously) and by using physical models that simulated the temperature of adult toads. We deployed 108 physical models in and adjacent to a 1-year old burn using a fully-replicated design with three burn severities (unburned, partial, high severity) and four microhabitats (open surface, under vegetation, under log, in burrow). Model temperatures were compared to a range of preferred temperatures in published studies. We found 70% more observations within the preferred temperature range of B. boreas in forests burned with high severity than in unburned areas. Burned forest was warmer than unburned forest across all microhabitats, but the largest relative difference was in burrows, which averaged 3 8C warmer in high-severity burn areas and remained warmer though the night. More than twice as many observations were within the preferred temperature range in high-severity burrows than in unburned burrows. Areas burned with high severity were still warmer than unburned forest 3 years after the ﬁre. Habitat use of toads during the concurrent radio telemetry study matched that predicted by the physical models. These results suggest there are ﬁtness-linked beneﬁts to toads using burned habitats, such as increased growth, fertility, and possibly disease resistance. However, increased soil temperatures that result from wildﬁre may be detrimental to other amphibian species that prefer cooler temperatures and stable environments. More broadly, our data illustrate the use of physical models to measure and interpret changes that amphibians may experience from disturbance, and highlight the need for research linking vital rates such as growth and survival to disturbance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hossack","given":"Blake R."},{"family":"Eby","given":"Lisa A."},{"family":"Guscio","given":"C.

Despite the relatively high prevalence of chytridiomycosis in stream amphibians globally, most surveys in North America have focused primarily on wetland-associated species, which are frequently infected. To better understand the distribution and prevalence of Bd in headwater amphibian communities, we sampled 452 tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei and Ascaphus montanus) and 304 stream salamanders (seven species in the Dicamptodontidae and Plethodontidae) for Bd in 38, first- to third-order streams in five montane areas across the United States. We tested for presence of Bd by using PCR on skin swabs from salamanders and metamorphosed tailed frogs or the oral disc of frog larvae. We detected Bd on only seven individuals (0.93%) in four streams. Based on our study and results from five other studies that have sampled headwater- or seep-associated amphibians in the United States, Bd has been detected on only 3% of 1,322 individuals from 21 species. These results differ strongly from surveys in Central America and Australia, where Bd is more prevalent on stream-breeding species, as well as results from wetland-associated anurans in the same regions of the United States that we sampled. Differences in the prevalence of Bd between stream- and wetland-associated amphibians in the United States may be related to species-specific variation in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis or habitat differences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hossack","given":"Blake R."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Campbell Grant","given":"Evan H."},{"family":"Pearl","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Bettaso","given":"James B."},{"family":"Barichivich","given":"William J."},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Winsor H."},{"family":"True","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Ware","given":"Joy L."},{"family":"Corn","given":"Paul Stephen"}],"citation-key":"hossack2010","container-title":"Journal of Herpetology","DOI":"10.1670/09-058.1","ISSN":"0022-1511","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"language":"en","page":"253-260","source":"Crossref","title":"Low prevalence of chytrid fungus (<i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>) in amphibians of U.S. headwater streams","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1670/09-058.1","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"hossack2011","abstract":"The increased frequency and severity of large wildfires in the western United States is an important ecological and management issue with direct relevance to amphibian conservation. Although the knowledge of fire effects on amphibians in the region is still limited relative to most other vertebrate species, we reviewed the current literature to determine if there are evident patterns that might be informative for conservation or management strategies. Of the seven studies that compared pre- and post-wildfire data on a variety of metrics, ranging from amphibian occupancy to body condition, two reported positive responses and five detected negative responses by at least one species. Another seven studies used a retrospective approach to compare effects of wildfire on populations: two studies reported positive effects, three reported negative effects from wildfire, and two reported no effects. All four studies that included plethodontid salamanders reported negative effects on populations or individuals; these effects were greater in forests where fire had been suppressed and in areas that burned with high severity. Species that breed in streams are also vulnerable to post-wildfire changes in habitat, especially in the Southwest. Wildfire is also important for maintaining suitable habitat for diverse amphibian communities, although those results may not be evident immediately after an area burns. We expect that wildfire will extirpate few healthy amphibian populations, but it is still unclear how populations will respond to wildfire in the context of land management (including pre- and post-fire timber harvest) and fragmentation. Wildfire may also increase the risk of decline or extirpation for small, isolated, or stressed (e.g., from drought or disease) populations. Improved understanding of how these effects vary according to changes in fire frequency and severity are critical to form more effective conservation strategies for amphibians in the western United States.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hossack","given":"Blake R."},{"family":"Pilliod","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"hossack2011","container-title":"Fire Ecology","DOI":"10.4996/fireecology.0702129","ISSN":"1933-9747","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8]]},"language":"en","page":"129-144","source":"Crossref","title":"Amphibian responses to wildfire in the western United States: emerging patterns from short-term studies","title-short":"Amphibian responses to wildfire in the western united states","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.4996/fireecology.0702129","volume":"7"},

Aquatic and moisture-sensitive species, such as amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to these modified disturbance regimes because large wildfires often occur during extended droughts and thus may compound environmental threats. However, understanding of the effects of wildfires on amphibians in forests with long fire-return intervals is limited. Numerous stand-replacing wildfires have occurred since 1988 in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3 amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between 1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate occupancy during prefire (0–4 years) and different postfire recovery periods. For the long-toed salamander ( Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Columbia spotted frog ( Rana luteiventris), occupancy was not affected for 6 years after wildfire. But 7–21 years after wildfire, occupancy for both species decreased ≥25% in areas where >50% of the forest within 500 m of wetlands burned. In contrast, occupancy of the boreal toad ( Anaxyrus boreas) tripled in the 3 years after low-elevation forests burned. This increase in occupancy was followed by a gradual decline. Our results show that accounting for magnitude of change and time lags is critical to understanding population dynamics of amphibians after large disturbances.

  {"id":"hossack2013a","abstract":"Projected increases in wildﬁre and other climate-driven disturbances will affect populations and communities worldwide, including host–parasite relationships. Research in temperate forests has shown that wildﬁre can negatively affect amphibians, but this research has occurred primarily outside of managed landscapes where interactions with human disturbances could result in additive or synergistic effects. Furthermore, parasites represent a large component of biodiversity and can affect host ﬁtness and population dynamics, yet they are rarely included in studies of how vertebrate hosts respond to disturbance. To determine how wildﬁre affects amphibians and their parasites, and whether effects differ between protected and managed landscapes, we compared abundance of two amphibians and two nematodes relative to wildﬁre extent and severity around wetlands in neighboring protected and managed forests (Montana, USA). Population sizes of adult, male long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) decreased with increased burn severity, with stronger negative effects on isolated populations and in managed forests. In contrast, breeding population sizes of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) increased with burn extent in both protected and managed protected forests. Path analysis showed that the effects of wildﬁre on the two species of nematodes were consistent with differences in their life history and transmission strategies and the responses of their hosts. Burn severity indirectly reduced abundance of soil-transmitted Cosmocercoides variabilis through reductions in salamander abundance. Burn severity also directly reduced C. variabilis abundance, possibly though changes in soil conditions. For the aquatically transmitted nematode Gyrinicola batrachiensis, the positive effect of burn extent on density of Columbia spotted frog larvae indirectly increased parasite abundance. Our results show that effects of wildﬁre on amphibians depend upon burn extent and severity, isolation, and prior land use. Through subsequent effects on the parasites, our results also reveal how changes in disturbance regimes can affect communities across trophic levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hossack","given":"Blake R."},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Winsor H."},{"family":"Honeycutt","given":"R.

Despite an increase in research on wildﬁre eﬀects on vertebrates, the vast majority of it has focused on short-term (< 5 years) eﬀects and there is still little information on the time scale of population recovery for species that decline in abundance after ﬁre. In 2003, a large wildﬁre in Montana (USA) burned the watersheds of four of eight streams that we sampled for larval Rocky Mountain tailed frogs (Ascaphus montanus) in 2001. Surveys during 2004–2005 revealed reduced abundance of larvae in burned streams relative to unburned streams, with greater declines associated with increased ﬁre extent. Rocky Mountain tailed frogs have low vagility and have several unusual life-history traits that could slow population recovery, including an extended larval period (4 years), delayed sexual maturity (6–8 years), and low fecundity (< 50 eggs/year). To determine if abundance remained depressed since the 2003 wildﬁre, we repeated surveys during 2014–2015 and found relative abundance of larvae in burned and unburned streams had nearly converged to pre-ﬁre conditions within two generations. The negative eﬀects of burn extent on larval abundance weakened > 58% within 12 years after the ﬁre. We also found moderate synchrony among populations in unburned streams and negative spatial autocorrelation among populations in burned streams. We suspect negative spatial autocorrelation among spatially-clustered burned streams reﬂected increased post-ﬁre patchiness in resources and diﬀerent rates of local recovery.

Capture-recapture and age data are commonly collected to investigate hypotheses about survival, reproduction, and viability. We present a novel age-structured Jolly-Seber model that incorporates age and capture-recapture data to provide comprehensive information on population dynamics, including abundance, age-dependent survival, recruitment, age structure, and population growth rates. We applied our model to a multi-year capture-recapture study of polar bears (\n              Ursus maritimus\n              ) in western Hudson Bay, Canada (2012–2018), where management and conservation require a detailed understanding of how polar bears respond to climate change and other factors. In simulation studies, the age-structured Jolly-Seber model improved precision of survival, recruitment, and annual abundance estimates relative to standard Jolly-Seber models that omit age information. Furthermore, incorporating age information improved precision of population growth rates, increased power to detect trends in abundance, and allowed direct estimation of age-dependent survival and changes in annual age structure. Our case study provided detailed evidence for senescence in polar bear survival. Median survival estimates were lower (<0.95) for individuals aged <5 years, remained high (>0.95) for individuals aged 7–22 years, and subsequently declined to near zero for individuals >30 years. We also detected cascading effects of large recruitment classes on population age structure, which created major shifts in age structure when these classes entered the population and then again when they reached prime breeding ages (10–15 years old).

  {"id":"hromada2018","abstract":"Fire can have diverse eﬀects on ecosystems, including direct eﬀects through injury and mortality and indirect eﬀects through changes to available resources within the environment. Changes in vegetation structure such as a decrease in canopy cover or an increase in herbaceous cover from prescribed ﬁre can increase availability of preferred microhabitats for some species while simultaneously reducing preferred conditions for others. We examined the responses of herpetofaunal communities to prescribed ﬁres in an oak/hickory forest in western Kentucky. Prescribed ﬁres were applied twice to a 1000-ha area one and four years prior to sampling, causing changes in vegetation structure. Herpetofaunal communities were sampled using drift fences, and vegetation attributes were sampled via transects in four burned and four unburned plots. Diﬀerences in reptile community structure correlated with variation in vegetation structure largely created by ﬁres. Amphibian community structure diﬀered on a yearly basis, indicating that sampled communities were likely inﬂuenced by environmental factors other than the burning. We found taxa-speciﬁc diﬀerences in abundances for Coluber constrictor, Diadophis punctatus, Sceloporus undulatus, Lithobates clamitans and snakes as a group, being more abundant in burned areas while Anaxyrus sp., Notophthalmus viridescens and Plethodon glutinosus were more abundant in unburned areas. Diﬀerences in amphibian taxa abundances may have been inﬂuenced by availability of aquatic breeding habitat and yearly weather variation. Our results suggest that the vegetation structure changes caused by prescribed ﬁre can have indirect impacts on reptile abundances and community structure, while not signiﬁcantly impacting amphibian communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Hromada","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Howey","given":"Christopher A.

CBFMs can be viewed as related to spatiotemporal latent variable models, where the latent variables are replaced by a set of pre-specified spatiotemporal basis functions which are common across species. In a CBFM, the coefficients that link the basis functions to each species are treated as random slopes. As such, the CBFM can be formulated to have a similar structure to a generalised additive model. This allows us to adapt existing techniques to fit CBFMs efficiently. CBFMs can be used for a variety of reasons, such as inferring patterns of habitat use in space and time, understanding how residual covariation between species varies spatially and/or temporally, and spatiotemporal predictions of species- and community-level quantities. A simulation study and an application to data from a bottom trawl survey conducted across the U.S. Northeast shelf show that CBFMs can achieve similar and sometimes better predictive performance compared to existing approaches for spatiotemporal joint species distribution modelling, while being computationally more scalable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hui","given":"Francis K.

This species has experienced drastic population declines because of habitat loss and degradation and now occurs only in scattered populations in the southern United States. We tracked the post-breeding movements and burrow use of 17 Gopher Frogs in the Sandhills of North Carolina using radio telemetry. Nine frogs were successfully tracked to summer refugia; the other eight frogs shed their transmitters or were killed by predators or ﬁre during migration. Frogs traveled 0.5-3.5 km (mean = 1.3 km) between the breeding pond and a summer refugium. The 3.5-km movement is substantially longer than has been reported for Gopher Frogs before. Our results suggest that an area of 3,739 ha (9,239 acres) around breeding ponds is required to provide summer habitat for Gopher Frogs. Eight of nine frogs used holes associated with the stumps of longleaf pines for their summer refugia, and we documented ﬁdelity to particular stumps, with one frog traveling long distances from breeding pond to the same summer refugium during two consecutive seasons. Frogs only made major movements during rainy nights. Prolonged presence on the forest ﬂoor during post-breeding migrations exposed frogs to prescribed ﬁres conducted in the spring. Prescribed burning within several kilometers of Gopher Frog ponds should be conducted after mid-May to reduce adult mortality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Humphries","given":"W.

  {"id":"humphries2022","abstract":"Amphibians are among the vertebrate groups suffering great losses of biodiversity due to a variety of causes including diseases, such as chytridiomycosis (caused by the fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans). The amphibian metamorphic period has been identified as being particularly vulnerable to chytridiomycosis, with dramatic physiological and immunological reorganisation likely contributing to this vulnerability. Here, we overview the processes behind these changes at metamorphosis and then perform a systematic literature review to capture the breadth of empirical research performed over the last two decades on the metamorphic immune response. We found that few studies focused specifically on the immune response during the peri-metamorphic stages of amphibian development and fewer still on the implications of their findings with respect to chytridiomycosis. We recommend future studies consider components of the immune system that are currently under-represented in the literature on amphibian metamorphosis, particularly path­ ogen recognition pathways. Although logistically challenging, we suggest varying the timing of exposure to Bd across metamorphosis to examine the relative importance of pathogen evasion, suppression or dysregulation of the immune system. We also suggest elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the increased susceptibility to chytridiomycosis at metamorphosis and the associated implications for population persistence. For species that overlap a distribution where Bd/Bsal are now endemic, we recommend a greater focus on management strategies that consider the important peri-metamorphic period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Humphries","given":"Josephine E."},{"family":"Lanctôt","given":"Chantal M."},{"family":"Robert","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish I."},{"family":"Newell","given":"David A."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."}],"citation-key":"humphries2022","container-title":"Developmental & Comparative Immunology","container-title-short":"Developmental & Comparative Immunology","DOI":"10.1016/j.dci.2022.104510","ISSN":"0145305X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"104510","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do immune system changes at metamorphosis predict vulnerability to chytridiomycosis?

As a result a two day 'National Threatened Frog Workshop' was held at the University of Canberra in November 1997 sponsored by Environment Australia, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the University of Canberra and the Worldwide Fund for Nature.The Workshop brought together some 80 people from throughout Australia and overseas involved in frog research, management and policy development and included representatives from government agencies, educational institutions and non-government organisations. The purpose of the Workshop was to: 1. provide an overview of the current status of knowledge about species which are declining; 2. provide an overview of what's known about the decline and how it is being tackled; 3. identify gaps in knowledge; 4. recommend priorities for notional effort for research, management and community attention; 5. help set future priority actions for the Working Group; and 6. establish on-going communication links between all participants and the wider community. Following the Workshop the Working Group met and emphasised: the need to maintain a broad perspective and to continue monitoring and research on a range of possible causal factors; the need to support research into new areas - particularly disease as a potentially major factor influencing global declines; the need to support strategic research and to develop protocols to address this issue; and the need to support research on fluctuating asymmetry as a possible early warning tool for predicting declines. They also requested that the workshop proceedings be published; that a brochure on declining frogs be prepared; that a web site to provide up to date information about declining frog issues be established and that a national but restricted internet discussion group on frogs should be established.y, it.","author":[{"family":"Hunter","given":"David"},{"family":"Osborne","given":"William"},{"family":"Marantelli","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"Green","given":"Ken"}],"citation-key":"hunter1999","container-title":"Declines and disappearances of Australian frogs","editor":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Alastair"}],"event-place":"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","ISBN":"978-0-642-54656-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 44894378","page":"158-167","publisher":"Biodiversity Group, Environment Australia","publisher-place":"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Implementation of a population augmentation project for remnant populations of the southern corroboree frog (<i>Pseudophyrne corroboree</i>)","type":"chapter"},

To date, there has been no adequate explanation as to what is causing the decline of these species. We investigated the possibility that a pathogen associated with other recent frog declines in Australia, the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, may have been implicated in the decline of the corroboree frogs. We used histology of toe material and real-time PCR of skin swabs to investigate the presence and infection rates with B. dendrobatidis in historic and extant populations of both corroboree frog species. Using histology, we did not detect any B. dendrobatidis infections in corroboree frog populations prior to their decline. However, using the same technique, high rates of infection were observed in populations of both species after the onset of substantial population declines. The real-time PCR screening of skin swabs identified high overall infection rates in extant populations of P. corroboree (between 44 and 59%), while significantly lower rates of infection were observed in low-altitude P. pengilleyi populations (14%). These results suggest that the initial and continued decline of the corroboree frogs may well be attributed to the emergence of B. dendrobatidis in populations of these species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunter","given":"D.

The fungus infects 2 amphibian orders (Anura and Caudata), 14 families and at least 200 species and is responsible for at least 1 species extinction. Whilst the origin of the agent and routes of transmission are being debated, it has been recognised that successful management of the disease will require effective sampling regimes and detection assays. We have developed a range of unique sampling protocols together with diagnostic assays for the detection of B. dendrobatidis in both living and deceased tadpoles and adults. Here, we formally present our data and discuss them in respect to assay sensitivity, specificity, repeatability and reproducibility. We suggest that compliance with the recommended protocols will avoid the generation of spurious results, thereby providing the international scientific and regulatory community with a set of validated procedures which will assist in the successful management of chytridiomycosis in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hyatt","given":"A.

  {"id":"iglay2014","abstract":"Managers of commercial forests are increasingly expected to incorporate conservation of biodiversity in forest management plans, but a paucity of information exists regarding herpetofaunal responses to mid-rotation release practices of dormant-season prescribed ﬁre and selective herbicide in intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) stands. However, these management tools have demonstrated capabilities of improving conservation value in these forests in the southeastern United States. Therefore, we investigated summer herpetofaunal responses to factorial combinations of dormant-season prescribed ﬁre and a commonly used herbicide (imazapyr) with a randomized complete block design of 6 mid-rotation pine stands with 4 experimental units in Mississippi, USA, to which we applied at random 1 of 4 treatments (i.e., burn only, herbicide only, burn þ herbicide, control). We captured 814 reptiles and 3,699 amphibians of 17 and 16 species, respectively, using drift-fence arrays during May and June, 1999–2007. Herpetofaunal assemblages only differed between burn þ herbicide and control plots in 2002. Species-speciﬁc responses were limited to differences across years within treatments and greater eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) relative abundance in burned or herbicide-treated sites soon after treatment. Furthermore, herpetofaunal associations with measured environmental variables (e.g., vegetation structure and biomass and trap-site characteristics) did not indicate that treatment inﬂuenced ﬂuctuations in species relative abundances. Consistent with past studies, forest managers of commercial pine forests using dormant-season prescribed ﬁre with or without imazapyr will most likely have minimal additional effects on herpetofaunal assemblages, but current knowledge gaps require additional research to better understand mechanisms of species abundance and persistence in these landscapes.

These issues concern some of the most fundamental advantages and disadvantages of each basic research design. Problems include improper use of hypothesis tests for covariate balance between the treated and control groups, and the consequences of using randomization, blocking before randomization and matching after assignment of treatment to achieve covariate balance. Applied researchers in a wide range of scientiﬁc disciplines seem to fall prey to one or more of these fallacies and as a result make suboptimal design or analysis choices. To clarify these points, we derive a new four-part decomposition of the key estimation errors in making causal inferences.

  {"id":"james2015","abstract":"The amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis, which affects species across all continents, recently emerged as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Yet, many aspects of the basic biology and epidemiology of the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), are still unknown, such as when and from where did Bd emerge and what is its true ecological niche? Here, we review the ecology and evolution of Bd in the Americas and highlight controversies that make this disease so enigmatic. We explore factors associated with variance in severity of epizootics focusing on the disease triangle of host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, and environment. Reevaluating the causes of the panzootic is timely given the wealth of data on Bd prevalence across hosts and communities and the recent discoveries suggesting co-evolutionary potential of hosts and Bd. We generate a new species distribution model for Bd in the Americas based on over 30,000 records and suggest a novel future research agenda. Instead of focusing on pathogen “hot spots,” we need to identify pathogen “cold spots” so that we can better understand what limits the pathogen’s distribution. Finally, we introduce the concept of “the Ghost of Epizootics Past” to discuss expected patterns in postepizootic host communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"James","given":"Timothy Y."},{"family":"Toledo","given":"L.

One approach is to generate high dimensional spaces, or hypervolumes, to answer ecological questions in a multivariate context. A range of statistical methods has been applied to construct hypervolumes but have not yet been applied in the context of ecological data sets with spatial or temporal structure, for example, where the data are nested or demonstrate temporal autocorrelation. We outline an approach to account for data structure in quantifying hypervolumes based on the multivariate normal distribution by including random effects. Using simulated data, we show that failing to account for structure in data can lead to biased estimates of hypervolume properties in certain contexts. We then illustrate the utility of these “model-based hypervolumes” in providing new insights into a case study of afforestation effects on ecosystem properties where the data has a nested structure. We demonstrate that the model-based generalization allows hypervolumes to be applied to a wide range of ecological data sets and questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Susan G."},{"family":"Henrys","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Keith","given":"Aidan M."},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Ellie"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Smart","given":"Simon M."}],"citation-key":"jarvis2019","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2676","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"e02676","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Model-based hypervolumes for complex ecological data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2676","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"jenkinson2016","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is the emerging infectious disease implicated in recent population declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Bd strains from regions of disease-associated amphibian decline to date have all belonged to a single, hypervirulent clonal genotype (Bd-GPL). However, earlier studies in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil detected a novel, putatively enzootic lineage (Bd-Brazil), and indicated hybridization between Bd-GPL and Bd-Brazil. Here, we characterize the spatial distribution and population history of these sympatric lineages in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. To investigate the genetic structure of Bd in this region, we collected and genotyped Bd strains along a 2400-km transect of the Atlantic Forest. Bd-Brazil genotypes were restricted to a narrow geographic range in the southern Atlantic Forest, while Bd-GPL strains were widespread and largely geographically unstructured. Bd population genetics in this region support the hypothesis that the recently discovered Brazilian lineage is enzootic in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and that Bd-GPL is a more recently expanded invasive. We collected additional hybrid isolates that demonstrate the recurrence of hybridization between panzootic and enzootic lineages, thereby conﬁrming the existence of a hybrid zone in the Serra da Graciosa mountain range of Parana  State. Our ﬁeld observations suggest that Bd-GPL may be more infective towards native Brazilian amphibians, and potentially more effective at dispersing across a fragmented landscape. We also provide further evidence of pathogen translocations mediated by the Brazilian ranaculture industry with implications for regulations and policies on global amphibian trade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jenkinson","given":"T.

  {"id":"jesper2023","abstract":"Many temperate reptiles survive winter by using subterranean refugia until external conditions become suitable for activity. Determining when to emerge from refugia relies on the ability to interpret when above-ground environmental conditions are survivable. If temperate reptiles rely on specific environmental cues such as temperature to initiate emergence, we should expect emergence phenologies to be predictable using local climatic data. However, specific predictors of emergence for many temperate reptiles, including the Timber Rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), remain unclear, limiting our understanding of their overwintering phenology and restricting effective conservation and management. Our objectives were to identify environmental cues of spring emergence for C. horridus in Illinois to determine the species’ emergence phenology, and to examine the applicability of identified cues in predicting emergence phenology across the species’ range. We used wildlife cameras and weather station-derived environmental data to observe and predict the daily surface presence of C. horridus throughout the late winter and early spring at communal refugia in west-central and northern Illinois. The most parsimonious model for predicting surface presence included the additive effects of maximum daily temperature, accumulated degree days, and latitude. With a notable exception in the southeastern U.S., the model accurately predicted the average emergence day for eight other populations range wide, emphasizing the importance of temperature in influencing the phenological plasticity observed across the species’ range. The apparent broad applicability of the model to other populations suggests it can be a valuable tool in predicting spring emergence phenology. Our results provide a foundation for further ecological enquiries and improved management and conservation strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Jesper","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Eckert","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Bielema","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Ballard","given":"Scott R."},{"family":"Dreslik","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"jesper2023","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.16044","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e16044","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"Phenology and predictors of spring emergence for the Timber Rattlesnake (<i>Crotalus horridus</i>)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/16044","volume":"11"},

Because broad-headed snakes are long-lived, grow slowly and reproduce infrequently, populations are likely vulnerable to increases in adult mortality. Long-term data revealed that annual survival rates of snakes were significantly lower in the ungated population than the gated population, consistent with the hypothesis of human removal of snakes for the pet trade. Population viability analysis showed that the ungated population has a strongly negative population growth rate and is only prevented from ultimate extinction by dispersal of small numbers of individuals from the gated population. Sensitivity analyses showed that the removal of a small number of adult females was sufficient to impose negative population growth and suggests that threatened species with slow life histories are likely to be especially vulnerable to illegal collecting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jolly","given":"Chris J."},{"family":"Von Takach","given":"Brenton"},{"family":"Webb","given":"Jonathan K."}],"citation-key":"jolly2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-84745-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"5380","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Slow life history leaves endangered snake vulnerable to illegal collecting","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84745-1","volume":"11"},

However, we know relatively little about how species respond to such climate fluctuations, with respect to variation in vital rates (i.e. survival, growth and reproduction of individuals) and population fluctuations. We examine whether populations display evidence of buffering against environmental variation in one of two ways: (1) through negative covariances among vital rates, or (2) reduction of variation in those vital rates to which population growth is most sensitive. We analyse time series of demographic data for 40 plant species and show that there is no evidence for either of these mechanisms. In species in which there is evidence for vital rate covariation, positive covariances between reproduction and survival rates predominate, and tend to magnify the effect of variability. Increasing climate variability is therefore expected to increase population fluctuations and extinction risks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jongejans","given":"Eelke"},{"family":"De Kroon","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Tuljapurkar","given":"Shripad"},{"family":"Shea","given":"Katriona"}],"citation-key":"jongejans2010","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01470.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"736-743","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Plant populations track rather than buffer climate fluctuations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01470.x","volume":"13"},

Subsequent disease can drive populations and even species to extinction. After establishment in populations, pathogens can continue to affect host dynamics, inﬂuencing the success or failure of species recovery efforts. However, quantifying the effect of pathogens on host populations in the wild is challenging because individual hosts and their pathogens are difﬁcult to observe. Here, we use long-term mark–recapture data to describe the dynamics of reintroduced populations of an endangered amphibian (Rana sierrae) and evaluate the success of these recovery efforts in the presence of a recently emerged pathogen, the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We ﬁnd that high B. dendrobatidis infection intensities are associated with increases in frog detectability and reductions in survival. When average infection intensities are high, adults are more likely to gain infections and less likely to lose infections. We also ﬁnd evidence for intensity-dependent survival, with heavily infected individuals suffering higher mortality. These results highlight the need in disease ecology for probabilistic approaches that account for uncertainty in infection intensity using imperfect observational data. Such approaches can advance the understanding of disease impacts on host population dynamics, and in the current study will improve the effectiveness of species conservation actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Joseph","given":"Maxwell B."},{"family":"Knapp","given":"Roland A."}],"citation-key":"joseph2018","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.2499","ISSN":"2150-8925, 2150-8925","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"e02499","source":"Crossref","title":"Disease and climate effects on individuals drive post‐reintroduction population dynamics of an endangered amphibian","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.2499","volume":"9"},

Classical ecological surveys, modern analytical tools and the establishment of online data bases will produce large multivariate data sets, which demands robust statistical tools to analyse and interpret hypervolumes. Existing approaches often have weaknesses; for example, they rely on multivariate normally or elliptically distributed data, perform poorly in higher dimensions, or their outputs vary arbitrarily with parameter choice. Here we introduce dynamic range boxes as a robust nonparametric approach to quantify size and overlap of n-dimensional hypervolumes. Dynamic range boxes (implemented in the r package dynRB) improve the concept of multivariate range boxes by accounting for the distribution of the data within their range, while still no assumptions on the underlying distributions are needed. In addition to calculating the whole n-dimensional hypervolume, the package dynRB also provides functions for a coordinate-wise analysis and interpretation of the data. The concept of dynamic range boxes reliably computes sizes and overlaps of n-dimensional hypervolumes, which makes dynamic range boxes readily applicable for a broad range of data sets to answer questions related to various disciplines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Junker","given":"Robert R."},{"family":"Kuppler","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Bathke","given":"Arne C."},{"family":"Schreyer","given":"Manuela L."},{"family":"Trutschnig","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"junker2016","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12611","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"1503-1513","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dynamic range boxes – a robust nonparametric approach to quantify size and overlap of <i>n</i>-dimensional hypervolumes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12611","volume":"7"},

We previously reported that the tadpole of bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana) is a useful model for the field surveillance of the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) distribution. In the present study, we compared Bd detection rates in swab-scraped and resected mouthpart samples, using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting detection rates for swab-scraped and resected specimens were 67 and 65%, respectively, with no significant difference. Furthermore, we performed a histopathological examination for Bd distribution in the mouthparts; we found that Bd infection occurred in the tip and basement of the jaw sheaths and tooth rows. We recommend using swab-scraped samples for Bd detection. Moreover, careful attention should be paid to scraping the tip and basement of the jaw sheaths and the entire oral cavity to reduce the rates of false-negative results on nested PCR of the mouthparts of bullfrog tadpoles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kadekaru","given":"Sho"},{"family":"Une","given":"Yumi"}],"citation-key":"kadekaru2018","container-title":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","DOI":"10.1292/jvms.17-0071","ISSN":"0916-7250, 1347-7439","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"260-262","source":"Crossref","title":"Comparison of methods for detection of chytrid fungus (<i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>) in bullfrog tadpole mouthparts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/80/2/80_17-0071/_article","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"kasler","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), poses a serious threat to amphibians. The thermal optimum of Bd is lower than that of most amphibians, providing an opportunity to cure infected individuals with elevated temperature. However, this approach presupposes detailed knowledge about the thermal tolerance of the fungus. To determine the temperature that may effectively reduce infection burdens in vivo, detailed in vitro studies are needed to characterize thermal tolerance of the fungus without complexities introduced by the species-specific characteristics of hosts’ immune systems. The aim of our study was to evaluate the thermal tolerance of a hypervirulent isolate of Bd, considering the limits of its thermal tolerance and its capacity to rebound following heat treatment. We incubated Bd cell cultures at five different temperatures (21, 25.5, 27, 29, or 30.5 C) for one of six exposure durations (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 days) and subsequently counted the number of zoospores to assess the temperature dependence of Bd growth. We observed intensive Bd growth at 21 C. At 25.5 C, the number of zoospores also increased over time, but the curve plateaued at about half of the maximum values observed in the lower temperature treatment. At temperatures of 27 C and above, the fungus showed no measurable growth. However, when we moved the cultures back to 21 C after the elevated temperature treatments, we observed recovery of Bd growth in all cultures previously treated at 27 C. At 29 C, a treatment duration of 8 days was necessary to prevent recovery of Bd growth, and at 30.5 C a treatment duration of 5 days was needed to achieve the same result, revealing that these moderately elevated temperatures applied for only a few days have merely a fungistatic rather than a fungicidal effect under in vitro conditions.","author":[{"family":"Kásler","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Ujszegi","given":"János"},{"family":"Holly","given":"Dóra"},{"family":"Jaloveczki","given":"Boglárka"},{"family":"Gál","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Hettyey","given":"Attila"}],"citation-key":"kasler","container-title":"Mycologia","DOI":"10.1080/00275514.2022.2065443","language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"In vitro thermal tolerance of a hypervirulent lineage of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>: Growth arrestment by elevated temperature and recovery following thermal treatment","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"kazila2019","abstract":"Vulnerability to toxic alien prey varies among native predator species, depending on their toxin resistance. Although foraging traits relating to the intake of prey are also likely to influence predator vulnerability to toxic alien prey, these traits have received little attention. To address this issue, we studied the toxic impacts of an alien prey species (Bufo japonicus formosus toad hatchlings) on a carnivorous and an omnivorous native amphibian species (Hynobius retardatus salamander larvae and Rana pirica frog tadpoles, respectively) that both feed on alien B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. First, we designed a mesocosm and an aquarium experiment to evaluate the impact of B. japonicus formosus on the survival of native amphibians under various alien prey densities and predation regimes. Second, we performed several additional laboratory experiments to clarify specific processes of native amphibian mortality in the presence of the alien B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. We found that both native amphibian species were impacted by the alien B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. Interestingly, R. pirica frog tadpoles were more affected than H. retardatus salamander larvae, partly due to their lower toxin resistance and their higher toad consumption rate. Most importantly, omnivorous foraging traits (i.e., food sharing and carcass consumption) demonstrated by R. pirica frog tadpoles, but not by the strictly carnivorous H. retardatus salamander larvae, rendered the former particularly vulnerable to the toxic B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. This is the first study suggesting that species-specific foraging traits such as food-sharing and carcass consumption can determine predator vulnerability to toxic alien prey. This study emphasises the importance of investigating a wider array of predator traits as factors that determine their vulnerability to toxic alien prey. By doing so, we can understand what types of native species are strongly impacted by toxic alien prey and predict the ecological consequences of toxic species invasion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kazila","given":"Evangelia"},{"family":"Kishida","given":"Osamu"}],"citation-key":"kazila2019","container-title":"Freshwater Biology","DOI":"10.1111/fwb.13194","ISSN":"1365-2427","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"56-70","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Foraging traits of native predators determine their vulnerability to a toxic alien prey","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fwb.13194","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"kellner2022","abstract":"Detection/non-detection data are increasingly collected in continuous time, e.g., via camera traps or acoustic sensors. Application of occupancy modeling approaches to these datasets typically requires discretizing the dataset to detections over individual days or weeks, which precludes analysis of temporal interactions between species or covariate relationships that change over fine temporal scales. To address this limitation, we developed a two-species occupancy model that assumes a temporal point process detection model. This model permits simultaneous analysis of species interactions in space (i.e., site occupancy) and time (i.e., activity patterns). The model is also capable of estimating the amount of time animals are available for detection, i.e., availability. We applied the model to detections of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote (Canis latrans) collected via camera trapping. We found evidence of both temporal and spatial interactions between deer and coyote. Detection intensity of deer was greater and proportionally more diurnal where coyotes were present. At hunted sites, coyotes were more likely to occur at sites where deer were also present (and vice versa). These results highlight how two-species occupancy models with a continuous-time detection process can be used to infer temporal interactions between species. Our approach broadens the set of questions ecologists can ask regarding both spatial and temporal interactions between species, as well as fine-scale temporal covariates (e.g., weather). Our model should be increasingly applicable given the increasing availability of ecological data collected in continuous time.

  {"id":"kendall1998","abstract":"Small populations are often at risk of extinction through processes that are effectively stochastic. Prediction of this extinction risk requires that the observed temporal variation in demographic rates be accurately partitioned between demographic stochasticity (variation among individuals) and environmental stochasticity (variation among years, correlated across individuals). However, studies of population viability analysis that include both forms of stochasticity parameterize the magnitude of environmental stochasticity incorrectly (they overestimate it). I describe and evaluate tests (1) to determine whether all the year-to-year variation in observed survivorship can be explained by demographic stochasticity alone, and (2) if not, to estimate the magnitude of environmental stochasticity in survival. The first issue can be resolved with a G test. I used simulated data to show that this test has an appropriate type I error rate, unless the individual survival probability is either very low or very high. Small amounts of environmental stochasticity often are not detected by the G test (type II error), but the hypothesis of demographic stochasticity alone is consistently rejected when environmental stochasticity is large. In contrast, estimating the magnitude of environmental stochasticity requires explicit hypotheses about the nature of the underlying variation, but I provide a flexible framework in which many such hypotheses can be examined. In particular, I show, using simulated data, that if the temporal variability in individual survival probabilities is distributed according to a beta distribution, then the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of the survival probability is biased, but in a consistent and correctable way. The estimate obtained with my method is usually superior to an estimate that assumes that all of the variation in the observed survivorship is due to environmental stochasticity. I show how to include deterministic sources of variability, such as density dependence, and how to apply different assumptions about the underlying environmental stochasticity. I illustrate these tests with data from a population of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus). With these data, I can determine that there is strong environmental stochasticity in juvenile survival, whereas variation in adult survival can be explained either by density dependence or by weak environmental stochasticity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kendall","given":"Bruce E."}],"citation-key":"kendall1998","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0184:ETMOES]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1939-5582","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"184-193","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Estimating the magnitude of environmental stochasticity in survivorship data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761%281998%29008%5B0184%3AETMOES%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"8"},

Nevertheless, in some cases animals can be misclassiﬁed. Using multiple capture sessions within each period of interest, we developed a method that adjusts estimates of transition probabilities for bias due to misclassiﬁcation. We applied this method to 10 years of sighting data for a population of Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) in order to estimate the annual probability of transition from nonbreeding to breeding status. Some sighted females were unequivocally classiﬁed as breeders because they were clearly accompanied by a ﬁrst-year calf. The remainder were classiﬁed, sometimes erroneously, as nonbreeders because an attendant ﬁrst-year calf was not observed or was classiﬁed as more than one year old.

Previous work has shown that ignoring state uncertainty biases estimates of survival and state transition probabilities, thereby reducing the power to detect effects. Efforts to adjust for state uncertainty have included special cases and a general framework for a single sample per period of interest. We provide a ﬂexible framework for adjusting for state uncertainty in multistate models, while utilizing multiple sampling occasions per period of interest to increase precision and remove parameter redundancy. These models also produce direct estimates of state structure for each primary period, even for the case where there is just one sampling occasion. We apply our model to expected-value data, and to data from a study of Florida manatees, to provide examples of the improvement in precision due to secondary capture occasions. We have also implemented these models in program MARK.

  {"id":"kendall2019","abstract":"Understanding population dynamics, and how it is influenced by exogenous and endogenous factors, is important to the study and conservation of species. Moreover, for migratory species, the phenology and duration of use of a given location can also influence population structure and dynamics. For many species, breeding abundance, survival, and reproductive performance, as well as phenology of nesting, are often the most accessible, and therefore, practical elements of their life history to study. For a population of hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), we modeled population change for nesters and total adult females, survival, and breeding probability, from 25 yr of intensive tagging data. We modeled breeding probability as a function of the number of years since last breeding and tested for differences between neophyte and experienced nesters. For each year, we also estimated the number of clutches deposited per female, and phenology of use, for neophytes and experienced nesters. To implement the analysis, we developed a novel generalized multistate open robust design mark–recapture modeling framework, with parameters for survival and transition probabilities, and for each primary period, state structure and arrival, persistence, and detection probabilities. Derived parameters included abundance of observable and unobservable components of the population, residence time, expected arrival and departure periods, and per-period intensity of study area use. Abundance of nesters increased over most of the time series. Survival probability was 0.935 ± 0.01 (estimate ± SE). Virtually all hawksbills skipped at least one year of nesting. Breeding probability increased by skipping a second year, but then decreased thereafter. Subsequent breeding probability was lower for neophyte nesters than for experienced nesters, but the effect was weaker than the effect of years since breeding. Clutch frequency varied by year, with no discernable pattern of differences between neophytes and experienced nesters. Mean arrival and departure dates also varied, with a slight shift of nesting activity to earlier in the season. The multistate open robust design model developed here provides a flexible framework for modeling the dynamics of structured migratory populations and the phenology and duration of their seasonal use of study areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kendall","given":"William L."},{"family":"Stapleton","given":"Seth"},{"family":"White","given":"Gary C."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"James I."},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Kristen N."},{"family":"Mason","given":"Peri"}],"citation-key":"kendall2019","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.1002/ecm.1329","ISSN":"1557-7015","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"e01329","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A multistate open robust design: population dynamics, reproductive effort, and phenology of sea turtles from tagging data","title-short":"A multistate open robust design","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecm.1329","volume":"89"},

We found no detectable dorsal pattern change during the nine-week period. Each individual had a distinct dorsal pattern, which remained distinguishable, although the majority of the froglets (80%) changed color (brown to green or vice versa). We conclude that the photographic identification method can be used for at least moderately sized samples of individual L. genimaculata juveniles and possibly other species, although studies similar to ours should be conducted to verify this.","author":[{"family":"Kenyon","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Phillott","given":"Andrea D."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."}],"citation-key":"kenyon2010","container-title":"Herpetological Conservation and Biology","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"126-131","source":"Zotero","title":"Temporal variation in dorsal patterns of juvenile green-eyed tree frogs, <i>Litoria genimaculata</i> (Anura: Hylidae)","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"kery2010b","abstract":"Abstract: Species’ assessments must frequently be derived from opportunistic observations made by volunteers (i.e., citizen scientists). Interpretation of the resulting data to estimate population trends is plagued with problems, including teasing apart genuine population trends from variations in observation effort. We devised a way to correct for annual variation in effort when estimating trends in occupancy (species distribution) from faunal or floral databases of opportunistic observations. First, for all surveyed sites, detection histories (i.e., strings of detection–nondetection records) are generated. Within-season replicate surveys provide information on the detectability of an occupied site. Detectability directly represents observation effort; hence, estimating detectablity means correcting for observation effort. Second, site-occupancy models are applied directly to the detection-history data set (i.e., without aggregation by site and year) to estimate detectability and species distribution (occupancy, i.e., the true proportion of sites where a species occurs). Site-occupancy models also provide unbiased estimators of components of distributional change (i.e., colonization and extinction rates). We illustrate our method with data from a large citizen-science project in Switzerland in which field ornithologists record opportunistic observations. We analyzed data collected on four species: the widespread Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) and Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the scarce Rock Thrush (Monticola saxatilis) and Wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria). Our method requires that all observed species are recorded. Detectability was <1 and varied over the years. Simulations suggested some robustness, but we advocate recording complete species lists (checklists), rather than recording individual records of single species. The representation of observation effort with its effect on detectability provides a solution to the problem of differences in effort encountered when extracting trend information from haphazard observations. We expect our method is widely applicable for global biodiversity monitoring and modeling of species distributions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kéry","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

  {"id":"ketz2018","abstract":"Accurate assessment of abundance forms a central challenge in population ecology and wildlife management. Many statistical techniques have been developed to estimate population sizes because populations change over time and space and to correct for the bias resulting from animals that are present in a study area but not observed. The mobility of individuals makes it difficult to design sampling procedures that account for movement into and out of areas with fixed jurisdictional boundaries. Aerial surveys are the gold standard used to obtain data of large mobile species in geographic regions with harsh terrain, but these surveys can be prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Estimating abundance with ground-based census methods have practical advantages, but it can be difficult to simultaneously account for temporary emigration and observer error to avoid biased results. Contemporary research in population ecology increasingly relies on telemetry observations of the states and locations of individuals to gain insight on vital rates, animal movements, and population abundance. Analytical models that use observations of movements to improve estimates of abundance have not been developed. Here we build upon existing multi-state mark–recapture methods using a hierarchical N-mixture model with multiple sources of data, including telemetry data on locations of individuals, to improve estimates of population sizes. We used a state-space approach to model animal movements to approximate the number of marked animals present within the study area at any observation period, thereby accounting for a frequently changing number of marked individuals. We illustrate the approach using data on a population of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in Northern Colorado, USA. We demonstrate substantial improvement compared to existing abundance estimation methods and corroborate our results from the ground based surveys with estimates from aerial surveys during the same seasons. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian N-mixture model using multiple sources of data on abundance, movement and survival to estimate the population size of a mobile species that uses remote conservation areas. The model improves accuracy of inference relative to previous methods for estimating abundance of open populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ketz","given":"Alison C."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Therese L."},{"family":"Monello","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Mack","given":"John A."},{"family":"George","given":"Janet L."},{"family":"Kraft","given":"Benjamin R."},{"family":"Wild","given":"Margaret A."},{"family":"Hooten","given":"Mevin B."},{"family":"Hobbs","given":"N.

Because fire impacts are poorly documented for herpetofaunal communities, we surveyed these stands in 1996 capturing 133 individuals often species during over 12,720 pitfall trapnights.

Based on a stepwise multiple regression model, Eastern Red-backed Salamander captures were more strongly influenced by landscape variables (P = 0.0320), including distance to permanent water and mesic (i.e., eastemnorthem) aspects, than by fire treatments (P = 0.26). Similar landscape models were not significant (P < 0.05) for toads or reptiles.

Aerial surveys are considered a useful method for estimating the population size of large conspicuous animals inhabiting large areas, but raw count data from aerial surveys usually underestimate population sizes due to imperfect detection. The use of N-mixture models with aerial count data provides a useful tool to estimate the population sizes while taking detection probability into account. As a study case we used aerial surveys conducted for monitoring black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in Madikwe Game Reserve and Pilanesberg Nature Reserve (South Africa) during 1999e2015, and we analysed data with a dynamic extension of the N-mixture model.

  {"id":"king2016","abstract":"We consider multi-state capture–recapture–recovery data where observed individuals are recorded in a set of possible discrete states. Traditionally, the Arnason–Schwarz model has been ﬁtted to such data where the state process is modeled as a ﬁrst-order Markov chain, though second-order models have also been proposed and ﬁtted to data. However, low-order Markov models may not accurately represent the underlying biology. For example, specifying a (time-independent) ﬁrst-order Markov process involves the assumption that the dwell time in each state (i.e., the duration of a stay in a given state) has a geometric distribution, and hence that the modal dwell time is one. Specifying time-dependent or higher-order processes provides additional ﬂexibility, but at the expense of a potentially signiﬁcant number of additional model parameters. We extend the Arnason–Schwarz model by specifying a semi-Markov model for the state process, where the dwell-time distribution is speciﬁed more generally, using, for example, a shifted Poisson or negative binomial distribution. A state expansion technique is applied in order to represent the resulting semi-Markov Arnason–Schwarz model in terms of a simpler and computationally tractable hidden Markov model. Semi-Markov Arnason–Schwarz models come with only a very modest increase in the number of parameters, yet permit a signiﬁcantly more ﬂexible state process. Model selection can be performed using standard procedures, and in particular via the use of information criteria. The semi-Markov approach allows for important biological inference to be drawn on the underlying state process, for example, on the times spent in the diﬀerent states. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a simulation study, before being applied to real data corresponding to house ﬁnches where the states correspond to the presence or absence of conjunctivitis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Langrock","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"king2016","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/biom.12446","ISSN":"0006341X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"en","page":"619-628","source":"Crossref","title":"Semi-Markov Arnason-Schwarz models","title-short":"Semi-Markov Arnason-Schwarz models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/biom.12446","volume":"72"},
  {"id":"kinney2011","abstract":"To fully comprehend chytridiomycosis, the amphibian disease caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), it is essential to understand how Bd affects amphibians throughout their remarkable range of life histories. Crawfish Frogs (Lithobates areolatus) are a typical North American pond-breeding species that forms explosive spring breeding aggregations in seasonal and semipermanent wetlands. But unlike most species, when not breeding Crawfish Frogs usually live singly—in nearly total isolation from conspecifics—and obligately in burrows dug by crayfish. Crayfish burrows penetrate the water table, and therefore offer Crawfish Frogs a second, permanent aquatic habitat when not breeding. Over the course of two years we sampled for the presence of Bd in Crawfish Frog adults. Sampling was conducted seasonally, as animals moved from post-winter emergence through breeding migrations, then back into upland burrow habitats. During our study, 53% of Crawfish Frog breeding adults tested positive for Bd in at least one sample; 27% entered breeding wetlands Bd positive; 46% exited wetlands Bd positive. Five emigrating Crawfish Frogs (12%) developed chytridiomycosis and died. In contrast, all 25 adult frogs sampled while occupying upland crayfish burrows during the summer tested Bd negative. One percent of postmetamorphic juveniles sampled were Bd positive. Zoospore equivalents/swab ranged from 0.8 to 24,436; five out of eight frogs with zoospore equivalents near or .10,000 are known to have died. In summary, Bd infection rates in Crawfish Frog populations ratchet up from near zero during the summer to over 25% following overwintering; rates then nearly double again during and just after breeding—when mortality occurs—before the infection wanes during the summer. Bd-negative postmetamorphic juveniles may not be exposed again to this pathogen until they take up residence in crayfish burrows, or until their first breeding, some years later.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kinney","given":"Vanessa C."},{"family":"Heemeyer","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Pessier","given":"Allan P."},{"family":"Lannoo","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"kinney2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0016708","editor":[{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Kirsten"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e16708","source":"Crossref","title":"Seasonal pattern of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection and mortality in <i>Lithobates areolatus</i>: Affirmation of Vredenburg's “10,000 Zoospore Rule”","title-short":"Seasonal Pattern of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Infection and Mortality in Lithobates areolatus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016708","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"klaus2016","abstract":"Available habitat within a landscape is often more limited for specialist species than for generalists. Therefore, specialists are potentially more vulnerable to extinction. The goal of our study was to better understand the ephemeral wetland habitat associations of specialist and generalist amphibians within a longleaf pine landscape in the southeastern United States. We also sought to determine specialist (e.g., oak toad [Anaxyrus quercicus], Maybee’s salamander [Ambystoma maybeei], pine woods treefrog [Hyla femoralis], carpenter frog [Lithobates virgatipes]) and generalist (e.g., spotted salamander [Ambystoma maculatum], Cope’s gray treefrog [Hyla chrysoscelis], southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus]) species’ responses to speciﬁc habitat restoration treatments. From 2005–2010, we examined the relationship between aquatic specialist and generalist amphibian species occupancy and wetland vegetation structure. We measured vegetation and amphibian responses to prescribed ﬁre and vegetation mulching (a ﬁre surrogate), plus a combination of mulching and burning. Untreated controls were wetlands that had not burned for 4–15 years. We combined data from this study and a previous study to elucidate patterns in amphibian assemblages in relation to ﬁre history. Specialist relative species richness was highest when canopy openness was high and leaf litter depth was low, conditions best achieved by mulching plus burning. Some specialist species were not detected in wetlands with >8 years since ﬁre, and some generalist species were not detected in wetlands with <2 years since ﬁre, indicating that as vegetation structure changes with time since ﬁre, there is a corresponding shift in the amphibian assemblage. Important patterns in species distributions can be overlooked if relationships to environment and responses to habitat change are too generalized and do not account for shifts in community composition. For conservation of longleaf pine specialist species, we recommend that uplands continue to be prescribed-burned on a 1–3-year return interval. Burning should occur during the early growing season when possible to maximize the probability that wetland basins burn. In cases where species of high conservation value are at imminent risk of extinction, we recommend a combination of mulching and burning to most quickly restore suitable habitat structure.

Here, Pelobates fuscus and Hyla orientalis tadpoles were separately exposed to non-lethal (free-moving, but with tied mouthparts) common carp Cyprinus carpio for one week in enclosures placed in a pond densely stocked with fish. Tadpoles exposed to nonlethal fish did not differ in mortality, body mass, or, except for deeper tail fin depth in P. fuscus, morphological plasticity from controls kept in a fishless pond. Hyla orientalis tadpoles recovered from the fish treatment were subsequently enclosed until metamorphosis in either the pond with fish or the fishless pond. Metamorphs from the pond containing fish were heavier, and did not differ in survivorship or development time from their counterparts initially kept in the fish treatment and then transferred to the fishless pond or from controls kept the entire time under fish-free conditions. The lack of apparent metamorphic costs is consistent with previous experiments on anuran larvae, but the morphological defenses induced (or their absence) are not. In the fish-dominated pond, carp indirectly affected tadpole developmental responses by generating turbidity, through adverse impacts on submerged vegetation and predatory insects, and by increasing food resource (unicellular algae) levels.

  {"id":"knapp2016","abstract":"Amphibians are one of the most threatened animal groups, with 32% of species at risk for extinction. Given this imperiled status, is the disappearance of a large fraction of the Earth’s amphibians inevitable, or are some declining species more resilient than is generally assumed? We address this question in a species that is emblematic of many declining amphibians, the endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (\n              Rana sierrae\n              ). Based on >7,000 frog surveys conducted across Yosemite National Park over a 20-y period, we show that, after decades of decline and despite ongoing exposure to multiple stressors, including introduced fish, the recently emerged disease chytridiomycosis, and pesticides,\n              R. sierrae\n              abundance increased sevenfold during the study and at a rate of 11% per year. These increases occurred in hundreds of populations throughout Yosemite, providing a rare example of amphibian recovery at an ecologically relevant spatial scale. Results from a laboratory experiment indicate that these increases may be in part because of reduced frog susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. The disappearance of nonnative fish from numerous water bodies after cessation of stocking also contributed to the recovery. The large-scale increases in\n              R. sierrae\n              abundance that we document suggest that, when habitats are relatively intact and stressors are reduced in their importance by active management or species’ adaptive responses, declines of some amphibians may be partially reversible, at least at a regional scale. Other studies conducted over similarly large temporal and spatial scales are critically needed to provide insight and generality about the reversibility of amphibian declines at a global scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Knapp","given":"Roland A."},{"family":"Fellers","given":"Gary M."},{"family":"Kleeman","given":"Patrick M."},{"family":"Miller","given":"David A.

We conducted\n              in-situ\n              antifungal treatment experiments in wild populations of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog during or immediately after Bd-caused mass die-off events. The objective of treatments was to reduce Bd infection intensity (“load”) and in doing so alter frog-Bd dynamics and increase the probability of frog population persistence despite ongoing Bd infection. Experiments included treatment of early life stages (tadpoles and subadults) with the antifungal drug itraconazole, treatment of adults with itraconazole, and augmentation of the skin microbiome of subadults with\n              Janthinobacterium lividum\n              , a commensal bacterium with antifungal properties. All itraconazole treatments caused immediate reductions in Bd load, and produced longer-term effects that differed between life stages. In experiments focused on early life stages, Bd load was reduced in the 2 months immediately following treatment and was associated with increased survival of subadults. However, Bd load and frog survival returned to pre-treatment levels in less than 1 year, and treatment had no effect on population persistence. In adults, treatment reduced Bd load and increased frog survival over the entire 3-year post-treatment period, consistent with frogs having developed an effective adaptive immune response against Bd. Despite this protracted period of reduced impacts of Bd on adults, recruitment into the adult population was limited and the population eventually declined to near-extirpation. In the microbiome augmentation experiment, exposure of subadults to a solution of\n              J. lividum\n              increased concentrations of this potentially protective bacterium on frogs. However, concentrations declined to baseline levels within 1 month and did not have a protective effect against Bd infection. Collectively, these results indicate that our mitigation efforts were ineffective in causing long-term changes in frog-Bd dynamics and increasing population persistence, due largely to the inability of early life stages to mount an effective immune response against Bd. This results in repeated recruitment failure and a low probability of population persistence in the face of ongoing Bd infection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Knapp","given":"Roland A."},{"family":"Joseph","given":"Maxwell B."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Thomas C."},{"family":"Hegeman","given":"Ericka E."},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."},{"family":"Erdman Jr","given":"James E."},{"family":"Boiano","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Jani","given":"Andrea J."},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Cheryl J."}],"citation-key":"knapp2022","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.12712","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,5]]},"language":"en","page":"e12712","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effectiveness of antifungal treatments during chytridiomycosis epizootics in populations of an endangered frog","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/12712","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"knowles2004","abstract":"Analyses of allozyme and mitochondrial nucleotide sequence variation in Philoria from northeastern NSW and southeastern Queensland revealed that there are more species than the three that are currently recognized. In addition to the three species presently recognized P. kundagungan, P. loveridgei, and P. sphagnicolus, another two species P. pughi n.sp. and P. richmondensis n.sp. were recognized under the evolutionary species concept. All species are allopatric. Each of the five species had two or more fixed genetic differences with all other species. Additionally, each species possessed two or more unique allozyme characters (apomorphies). Each species had strongly supported reciprocally monophyletic mitochondrial haplotypes in comparison with each of the other species. Multivariate morphometric analysis was able to distinguish P. sphagnicolus from the remaining four northern taxa but was unsuccessful in reliably distinguishing the two new species. Mating call analysis identified two distinct call groups: P. sphagnicolus and the remaining species, the latter showing little discrimination between species. The distribution of Philoria in NSW and Queensland shows a strong association with high rainfall rainforest at mid to high altitudes (above 600 m elevation). The habitat of all species is remarkably similar, all are found predominantly in the headwaters of rainforest streams or soaks on the forest floor. All species lay their eggs in nests in the ground, where the larvae remain throughout their entire development until they emerge post metamorphosis. It was confirmed that nests where the embryos were at an early stage of development were of two types: foaming egg masses, and nests containing a non-foaming jelly substance. All species are limited in their distribution. In particular P. richmondensis is in need of special conservation consideration, as it is known from only three localities within a very small range. A number of populations in southeastern Queensland and northern NSW await molecular analysis to be identified with certainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Knowles","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Donnellan","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"knowles2004","container-title":"Records of the Australian Museum","DOI":"10.3853/j.0067-1975.56.2004.1391","ISSN":"0067-1975","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4,7]]},"language":"en","page":"57-74","source":"Crossref","title":"Systematics of sphagnum frogs of the genus <i>Philoria</i> (Anura: Myobatrachidae) in eastern Australia, with the description of two new species","title-short":"Systematics of sphagnum frogs of the genus Philoria (Anura","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.australianmuseum.net.au/knowles-et-al-2004-rec-aust-mus-561-5774/","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"kosch2013","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis is an amphibian disease of global conservation concern that is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Since the discovery of Bd in 1998, several methods have been used for detection of Bd; among these polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from skin swabs is accepted as the best method due to its noninvasiveness, high sensitivity and ease of use. However, PCR is not without problems – to be successful, this technique is dependent upon the presence of nondegraded DNA template and reaction contents that are free from inhibitors. Here, we report on an investigation of several techniques aimed at improving the reliability of the Bd PCR assay by minimizing the effects of humic acid (HA), a potent PCR inhibitor. We compared the effectiveness of four DNA extraction kits (DNeasy, QIAamp DNA Stool, PowerLyzer Power Soil and PrepMan Ultra) and four PCR methods (Amplitaq Gold, bovine serum albumin, PowerClean DNA Clean-up and inhibitor resistant Taq Polymerase). The results of this and previous studies indicate that chytridiomycosis studies that use PCR methods for disease detection may be signiﬁcantly underestimating the occurrence of Bd. Our results suggest that to minimize the inhibitory effects of HA, DNeasy should be used for sample DNA extraction and Amplitaq Gold with bovine serum albumin should be used for the Bd PCR assay.

We examined the temporal pattern of chytrid infection in individually marked Stony Creek Frogs (Litoria wilcoxii) at a lowland site in southeast Queensland, Australia. We provide the ﬁrst evidence that wild frogs are capable of both acquiring chytridiomycosis as adults, and also of clearing their infections entirely. Changes in disease status in individual frogs largely tracked changing climatic conditions, with infections tending to appear in cooler months and disappearing in warmer months. Though 27.2% of the adult frogs we sampled were infected at some point in the study, we found no evidence that chytridiomycosis was negatively affecting adult survivorship, suggesting either: (1) chytrid-induced mortality in this population is generally restricted to metamorphs and juveniles; (2) this population was not exposed to conditions which favored lethal disease outbreaks; or (3) this population has evolved sufﬁcient resistance to the disease to persist relatively unaffected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kriger","given":"Kerry M."},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"kriger2006","container-title":"EcoHealth","DOI":"10.1007/s10393-006-0027-7","ISSN":"1612-9202, 1612-9210","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,22]]},"language":"en","page":"171-177","source":"Crossref","title":"Survivorship in wild frogs infected with chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10393-006-0027-7","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"kriger2007a","abstract":"The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been implicated as the causative agent of mass mortalities, population declines, and the extinctions of streambreeding amphibian species worldwide. While the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of B. dendrobatidis across large geographical regions are fairly well understood, little is known about the distribution of the fungus within localized areas such as individual catchments. The accurate identiﬁcation of amphibian populations likely to be exposed to the fungus is urgently required for effective disease management. We conducted disease surveys of frogs representing ﬁve ecological guilds in south-east Queensland, Australia, and hypothesized that if B. dendrobatidis were responsible for the disappearance of stream-breeding amphibian populations, infection prevalence and intensity would be greatest in frogs breeding in permanent, ﬂowing water. Overall, 30.3% of the 519 frogs we sampled were infected with B. dendrobatidis. However, infections were not evenly distributed across the ecological guilds, being almost completely restricted to frogs breeding at permanent waterbodies. Of these, stream breeders were signiﬁcantly more likely to be infected than were pond breeders, though the intensity of frogs’ infections did not differ signiﬁcantly between the two guilds. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was detected on only one of the 117 frogs that were found at ephemeral ponds, ephemeral streams, or terrestrial sites. These ﬁndings provide strong support for the hypothesis that B. dendrobatidis was responsible for many of the unexplained disappearances of stream-breeding amphibian populations in recent decades, and will enable wildlife managers to more accurately focus conservation efforts on those species at highest risk of diseaserelated decline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kriger","given":"Kerry M."},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"kriger2007a","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00394.x","ISSN":"13669516, 14724642","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7,26]]},"language":"en","page":"781-788","source":"Crossref","title":"The chytrid fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> is non-randomly distributed across amphibian breeding habitats","title-short":"The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is non-randomly distributed across amphibian breeding habitats","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00394.x","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"kriger2007b","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis is a recently emerged, infectious skin disease of amphibians that has been linked directly to mass mortalities, population declines, and species extinctions worldwide. An understanding of the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the etiological agent of chytridiomycosis) is urgently required. We conducted disease surveys at 31 lowland sites distributed north–south along 2315 km of the Australian east coast that encompassed 20.8 degrees of latitude. A total of 863 adult male stony creek frogs (Litoria lesueuri complex) were sampled, and the overall prevalence of B. dendrobatidis infection was 26%. B. dendrobatidis was detected at 77% of the sites, including sites at the northern and southern limits of the latitudinal transect. Frogs from temperate regions, however, had significantly more intense infections than did their tropical counterparts, often carrying an order of magnitude more B. dendrobatidis zoospores, suggesting that at low elevations, temperate frogs are at higher risk of chytridiomycosis-induced mortality than are tropical frogs. The prevalence and intensity of B. dendrobatidis infections were significantly greater at sites with high rainfall (>33 mm in the 30 days prior to sampling) and cool temperatures (stream temperature 1 h after sunset < 23◦ C). Although climatic variables explained much of the variation in the prevalence and intensity of B. dendrobatidis infections between infected and uninfected sites, frog snout-vent length was consistently the best predictor of infection levels across infected sites. Small frogs were more likely to be infected and carried more intense infections than larger frogs, suggesting either that frogs can outgrow their chytrid infections or that the disease induces developmental stress that limits growth. Our results will directly assist amphibian disease researchers and wildlife managers, whose conservation efforts should focus on those amphibian populations living within the B. dendrobatidis climatic envelope that we have described.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kriger","given":"Kerry M."},{"family":"Pereoglou","given":"Felicia"},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"kriger2007b","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00777.x","ISSN":"0888-8892, 1523-1739","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1280-1290","source":"Crossref","title":"Latitudinal variation in the prevalence and intensity of chytrid (<i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>) infection in eastern Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00777.x","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"kriger2008","abstract":"The disappearance of amphibian populations from seemingly pristine upland areas worldwide has become a major focus of conservation efforts in the last two decades, and a parasitic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is thought to be the causative agent of the population declines. We examined the altitudinal distribution of chytrid infections in three stream-dwelling frog species (Litoria wilcoxii, L. pearsoniana and L. chloris) in southeast Queensland, Australia, and hypothesized that if B. dendrobatidis were responsible for the disappearance of high-altitude frog populations, infection prevalence and intensity would be greatest at higher altitudes. Overall, 37.7% of the 798 adult frogs we sampled were infected with B. dendrobatidis, and infections were found in all the populations we examined. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found no consistent evidence that high-altitude frogs were more likely to be infected than were lowland frogs. Further, the intensity of fungal infections (number of zoospores) on high-altitude frogs did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of lowland frogs. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis appears to be capable of infecting frogs at all altitudes in the subtropics, suggesting that all populations are at risk of decline when conditions favour disease outbreaks. We did ﬁnd evidence, however, that chytrid infections persist longer into summer in upland as compared with lowland areas, suggesting that montane amphibian populations remain susceptible to disease outbreaks for longer periods than do lowland populations. Further, we found that at high altitudes, temperatures optimal for chytrid growth and reproduction coincide with frog metamorphosis, the life-stage at which frogs are most susceptible to chytrid infections. While these altitudinal differences may account for the differential population-level responses to the presence of B. dendrobatidis, the reason why many of southeast Queensland’s montane frog populations declined precipitously while lowland populations remained stable has yet to be resolved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kriger","given":"Kerry M."},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"kriger2008","container-title":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01872.x","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10,30]]},"language":"en","page":"1022-1032","source":"Crossref","title":"Altitudinal distribution of chytrid (<i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>) infection in subtropical Australian frogs","title-short":"Altitudinal distribution of chytrid (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) infection in subtropical Australian frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01872.x","volume":"33"},

In fact, as we show in this paper, if we begin with the interpretation that many researchers wrongly assign to the two-way FE model—that it represents a single estimate of X on Y while accounting for unit-level heterogeneity and time shocks—the two-way FE specification is statistically unidentified, a fact that statistical software packages like R and Stata obscure through internal matrix processing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kropko","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Kubinec","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"kropko2020","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0231349","editor":[{"family":"Al-Ameri","given":"Talib"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e0231349","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interpretation and identification of within-unit and cross-sectional variation in panel data models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231349","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"kung2014","abstract":"Microbial communities can augment host immune responses and probiotic therapies are under development to prevent or treat diseases of humans, crops, livestock, and wildlife including an emerging fungal disease of amphibians, chytridiomycosis. However, little is known about the stability of host-associated microbiota, or how the microbiota is structured by innate immune factors including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) abundant in the skin secretions of many amphibians. Thus, conservation medicine including therapies targeting the skin will benefit from investigations of amphibian microbial ecology that provide a model for vertebrate host-symbiont interactions on mucosal surfaces. Here, we tested whether the cutaneous microbiota of Panamanian rocket frogs, Colostethus panamansis, was resistant to colonization or altered by treatment. Under semi-natural outdoor mesocosm conditions in Panama, we exposed frogs to one of three treatments including: (1) probiotic - the potentially beneficial bacterium Lysinibacillus fusiformis, (2) transplant – skin washes from the chytridiomycosis-resistant glass frog Espadarana prosoblepon, and (3) control – sterile water. Microbial assemblages were analyzed by a culture-independent T-RFLP analysis. We found that skin microbiota of C. panamansis was resistant to colonization and did not differ among treatments, but shifted through time in the mesocosms. We describe regulation of host AMPs that may function to maintain microbial community stability. Colonization resistance was metabolically costly and microbe-treated frogs lost 7–12% of body mass. The discovery of strong colonization resistance of skin microbiota suggests a well-regulated, rather than dynamic, host-symbiont relationship, and suggests that probiotic therapies aiming to enhance host immunity may require an approach that circumvents host mechanisms maintaining equilibrium in microbial communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Küng","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Bigler","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Leyla R."},{"family":"Gratwicke","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Griffith","given":"Edgardo"},{"family":"Woodhams","given":"Douglas C."}],"citation-key":"kung2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0087101","editor":[{"family":"Sturtevant","given":"Joy"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e87101","source":"Crossref","title":"Stability of microbiota facilitated by host immune regulation: Informing probiotic strategies to manage amphibian disease","title-short":"Stability of Microbiota Facilitated by Host Immune Regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087101","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"kutt2007","abstract":"We studied the response of vegetation and vertebrate assemblages to ﬁre and grazing, and their interacting effects, in Eucalyptus woodland in north-eastern Australia. In this vegetation type, many pastures remain free of cattle grazing due to the occurrence of a native shrub poisonous to livestock. Vegetation (ﬂoristic data and 22 habitat variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds, mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 × 50-m quadrats in the 2001 wet season, representing four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2 y) and grazed by cattle (4–8 ha per livestock unit); sites unburnt (last burnt >2 y ago) and grazed; sites burnt recently and ungrazed; and unburnt and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on vegetation: both grazing and ﬁre reduced ground cover (ﬁre in grazed sites 51–23%, ﬁre in ungrazed sites 68–39%) and increased the cover of forbs (8% in burnt and grazed sites, 3% if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20% in grazed and unburnt sites and 5% when ungrazed). Grazing caused a shift in ﬂoristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses (e.g. Aristida spp., Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups, birds responded more to ﬁre effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction (2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas cucullatus, Ctenophorus nuchalis) and to the dominant ground cover (e.g. Ctenotus pantherinus) or change in vegetation architecture (e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomys delicatulus and P. desertor, the latter’s post-ﬁre recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle grazed (modelled time for population recovery twice as long as in ungrazed sites).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Kutt","given":"Alex.

  {"id":"kutt2012","abstract":"Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the rangelands of Australia. There is limited information on the effects of grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and the establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to attempt an examination of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of the manipulation of stocking rates. The aim was to identify what the relative effects of vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental factors were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha sites were established within three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry seasons in 1999–2000 (T0) and again in 2003–04 (T1). All paddocks of the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined markedly between the two sampling periods, which made interpretation of the data difﬁcult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna comprising ﬁve amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition from T0 to T1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between the grazing stocking rate treatments were less well deﬁned. There was a relative change in abundance of 24 bird, four mammal and ﬁve reptile species from T0 to T1. The generalised linear modelling identiﬁed that, in the T1 data, there was signiﬁcant variation in the abundance of 16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did change and that these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking rates, the vegetation types on the sites surveyed, the burning of the experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of the two surveys. It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa (i.e. birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling and replication of the data. This would help to articulate more clearly the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of stocking rates compared with wider landscape environmental changes. Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern Australia, any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should be taken for the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kutt","given":"A.

  {"id":"lachish2018","abstract":"Wildlife diseases have important implications for wildlife and human health, the preservation of biodiversity and the resilience of ecosystems. However, understanding disease dynamics and the impacts of pathogens in wild populations is challenging because these complex systems can rarely, if ever, be observed without error. Uncertainty in disease ecology studies is commonly defined in terms of either heterogeneity in detectability (due to variation in the probability of encountering, capturing, or detecting individuals in their natural habitat) or uncertainty in disease state assignment (due to misclassification errors or incomplete information). In reality, however, uncertainty in disease ecology studies extends beyond these components of observation error and can arise from multiple varied processes, each of which can lead to bias and a lack of precision in parameter estimates. Here, we present an inventory of the sources of potential uncertainty in studies that attempt to quantify disease-relevant parameters from wild populations (e.g., prevalence, incidence, transmission rates, force of infection, risk of infection, persistence times, and disease-induced impacts). We show that uncertainty can arise via processes pertaining to aspects of the disease system, the study design, the methods used to study the system, and the state of knowledge of the system, and that uncertainties generated via one process can propagate through to others because of interactions between the numerous biological, methodological and environmental factors at play. We show that many of these sources of uncertainty may not be immediately apparent to researchers (for example, unidentified crypticity among vectors, hosts or pathogens, a mismatch between the temporal scale of sampling and disease dynamics, demographic or social misclassification), and thus have received comparatively little consideration in the literature to date. Finally, we discuss the type of bias or imprecision introduced by these varied sources of uncertainty and briefly present appropriate sampling and analytical methods to account for, or minimise, their influence on estimates of disease-relevant parameters. This review should assist researchers and practitioners to navigate the pitfalls of uncertainty in wildlife disease ecology studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lachish","given":"Shelly"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Kris A."}],"citation-key":"lachish2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"lamarca2005","abstract":"We surveyed the population status of the Neotropical toad genus Atelopus, and document recent catastrophic declines that are more severe than previously reported for any amphibian genus. Of 113 species that have been described or are candidates for description, data indicate that in 42 species, population sizes have been reduced by at least half and only ten species have stable populations. The status of the remaining taxa is unknown. At least 30 species have been missing from all known localities for at least 8 yr and are feared extinct. Most of these species were last seen between 1984 and 1996. All species restricted to elevations of above 1000 m have declined and 75 percent have disappeared, while 58 percent of lowland species have declined and 38 percent have disappeared. Habitat loss was not related to declines once we controlled for the effects of elevation. In fact, 22 species that occur in protected areas have disappeared. The fungal disease Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been documented from nine species that have declined, and may explain declines in higher elevation species that occur in undisturbed habitats. Climate change may also play a role, but other potential factors such as environmental contamination, trade, and introduced species are unlikely to have affected more than a handful of species. Widespread declines and extinctions in Atelopus may reflect population changes in other Neotropical amphibians that are more difficult to survey, and the loss of this trophic group may have cascading effects on other species in tropical ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"La Marca","given":"Enrique"},{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."},{"family":"Lötters","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Puschendorf","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ibáñez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Rueda‐Almonacid","given":"José Vicente"},{"family":"Schulte","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Marty","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Manzanilla‐Puppo","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"García‐Pérez","given":"Juan Elías"},{"family":"Bolaños","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Chaves","given":"Gerardo"},{"family":"Pounds","given":"J.

  {"id":"lampo2012","abstract":"Atelopus is among the most threatened of all amphibian genera. Most species of harlequin frogs disappeared more than two decades ago and only a few still exist. From ten critically endangered Atelopus species endemic to Venezuela, Atelopus cruciger is the only one that can be located at present. To assess the status of remnant populations of A. cruciger and to provide the demographic data for designing in situ management programs, we estimated: (1) the population size; (2) the apparent survival; and (3) the recruitment rates of one remnant population using mark-recapture data. The adult population size varied (69–117), and this variation was not related to that of abundance indices based on visual counts at the river margins. Thus, caution is recommended when using visual counts as an index of abundance in Atelopus, because capture rates differ signiﬁcantly among months and between seasons. Despite the observed variations, this population appears to be stable. Previous reports suggest that species of Atelopus are long-lived. For populations of long-lived species to remain approximately constant, recruitment must be low. Our mark-recapture study, however, showed that adults tend to remain in the population for approximately 15 mo, but an average of 165 new frogs are recruited every year. Although immigration and emigration are possibilities, the site ﬁdelity and the absence of nearby streams suggests that movement in and out of the study area is less important than births and deaths. Under the proposed hypothesis of a short life expectancy/high recruitment, the risk of extinction must be lower than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lampo","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Celsa","given":"Señaris J."},{"family":"Rodríguez-Contreras","given":"Argelia"},{"family":"Rojas-Runjaic","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"García","given":"Carmen Z."}],"citation-key":"lampo2012","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/j.1744-7429.2011.00830.x","ISSN":"00063606","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5]]},"language":"en","page":"420-426","source":"Crossref","title":"High turnover rates in remnant populations of the harlequin frog <i>Atelopus cruciger</i> (Bufonidae): low risk of extinction?","title-short":"High Turnover Rates in Remnant Populations of the Harlequin Frog Atelopus cruciger (Bufonidae)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2011.00830.x","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"lampo2017","abstract":"Harlequin toads (Atelopus) are among the most severely impacted amphibians by the emergence of chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Many species disappeared while others suffered drastic contractions of their geographic distribution to lower altitudes. A diminished virulence of Bd in warm habitats was proposed to explain the survival of lowland populations of harlequin toads (i.e. thermal refuge hypothesis). To understand the mechanisms that allow some populations to reach an endemic equilibrium with this pathogen, we estimated demographic and epidemiological parameters at one remnant population of Atelopus cruciger in Venezuela using markrecapture data from 2007–2013. We demonstrated that Bd is highly virulent for A. cruciger, increasing the odds of dying of infected adults four times in relation to uninfected ones and reducing the life expectancy of reproductive toads to a few weeks. Despite an estimated annual loss of 18% of the reproductive population due to Bd-induced mortality, this population has persisted in an endemic equilibrium for the last decade through the large recruitment of healthy adults every year. Given the high vulnerability of harlequin toads to Bd in lowland populations, thermal refuges need to be redefined as habitats of reduced transmission rather than attenuated virulence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lampo","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Señaris","given":"Celsa"},{"family":"García","given":"Carmen Zulay"}],"citation-key":"lampo2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0179007","editor":[{"family":"Gratwicke","given":"Brian"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e0179007","source":"Crossref","title":"Population dynamics of the critically endangered toad <i>Atelopus cruciger</i> and the fungal disease chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179007","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"langhammer2013","abstract":"Laboratory investigations into the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), have accelerated recently, given the pathogen’s role in causing the global decline and extinction of amphibians. Studies in which host animals were exposed to Bd have largely assumed that lab-maintained pathogen cultures retained the infective and pathogenic properties of wild isolates. Attenuated pathogenicity is common in artificially maintained cultures of other pathogenic fungi, but to date, it is unknown whether, and to what degree, Bd might change in culture. We compared zoospore production over time in two samples of a single Bd isolate having different passage histories: one maintained in artificial media for more than six years (JEL427-P39), and one recently thawed from cryopreserved stock (JEL427-P9). In a common garden experiment, we then exposed two different amphibian species, Eleutherodactylus coqui and Atelopus zeteki, to both cultures to test whether Bd attenuates in pathogenicity with in vitro passages. The culture with the shorter passage history, JEL427-P9, had significantly greater zoospore densities over time compared to JEL427-P39. This difference in zoospore production was associated with a difference in pathogenicity for a susceptible amphibian species, indicating that fecundity may be an important virulence factor for Bd. In the 130-day experiment, Atelopus zeteki frogs exposed to the JEL427-P9 culture experienced higher average infection intensity and 100% mortality, compared with 60% mortality for frogs exposed to JEL427-P39. This effect was not observed with Eleutherodactylus coqui, which was able to clear infection. We hypothesize that the differences in phenotypic performance observed with Atelopus zeteki are rooted in changes of the Bd genome. Future investigations enabled by this study will focus on the underlying mechanisms of Bd pathogenicity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Langhammer","given":"Penny F."},{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."},{"family":"Burrowes","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Tunstall","given":"Tate"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Crystal M."},{"family":"Collins","given":"James P."}],"citation-key":"langhammer2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077630","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e77630","source":"Crossref","title":"A fungal pathogen of amphibians, <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i>, attenuates in pathogenicity with in vitro passages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077630","volume":"8"},

For example, the immature immune systems of young vertebrates, along with limited prior exposure to pathogens and behavioral factors, can place juveniles at greater risk of acquiring and succumbing to a pathogen. We studied the ontogenetic susceptibility of terrestrial direct-developing frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui) to the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which is responsible for the decline of amphibian species worldwide. By exposing juvenile and adult frogs to the same dose and strain of Bd, we uncovered ontogenetic differences in susceptibility. Froglets exposed to the pathogen had significantly lower survival rates compared with control froglets, while adult frogs largely cleared infection and had survival rates indistinguishable from control frogs, even when exposed to a much higher dose of Bd. The high disease-induced mortality rate of juveniles may explain ongoing population declines in eastern Puerto Rico, where Bd is endemic and juveniles experience higher prevalence and infection intensity compared to adults.

  {"id":"langwig2016","abstract":"Disease can play an important role in structuring species communities because the effects of disease vary among hosts; some species are driven towards extinction, while others suffer relatively little impact. Why disease impacts vary among host species remains poorly understood for most multi-host pathogens, and factors allowing less-susceptible species to persist could be useful in conserving highly affected species. White-nose syndrome (WNS), an emerging fungal disease of bats, has decimated some species while sympatric and closely related species have experienced little effect. We analysed data on infection prevalence, fungal loads and environmental factors to determine how variation in infection among sympatric host species influenced the severity of WNS population impacts. Intense transmission resulted in almost uniformly high prevalence in all species. By contrast, fungal loads varied over 3 orders of magnitude among species, and explained 98% of the variation among species in disease impacts. Fungal loads increased with hibernating roosting temperatures, with bats roosting at warmer temperatures having higher fungal loads and suffering greater WNS impacts. We also found evidence of a threshold fungal load, above which the probability of mortality may increase sharply, and this threshold was similar for multiple species. This study demonstrates how differences in behavioural traits among species—in this case microclimate preferences—that may have been previously adaptive can be deleterious after the introduction of a new pathogen. Management to reduce pathogen loads rather than exposure may be an effective way of reducing disease impact and preventing species extinctions.\n            This article is part of the themed issue ‘Tackling emerging fungal threats to animal health, food security and ecosystem resilience’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Langwig","given":"Kate E."},{"family":"Frick","given":"Winifred F."},{"family":"Hoyt","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Parise","given":"Katy L."},{"family":"Drees","given":"Kevin P."},{"family":"Kunz","given":"Thomas H."},{"family":"Foster","given":"Jeffrey T."},{"family":"Kilpatrick","given":"A.

  {"id":"lannoo2011","abstract":"The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been devastating amphibians globally. Two general scenarios have been proposed for the nature and spread of this pathogen: Bd is an epidemic, spreading as a wave and wiping out individuals, populations, and species in its path; and Bd is endemic, widespread throughout many geographic regions on every continent except Antarctica. To explore these hypotheses, we conducted a transcontinental transect of United States Department of Defense (DoD) installations along U.S. Highway 66 from California to central Illinois, and continuing eastward to the Atlantic Seaboard along U.S. Interstate 64 (in sum from Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia). We addressed the following questions: 1) Does Bd occur in amphibian populations on protected DoD environments? 2) Is there a temporal pattern to the presence of Bd? 3) Is there a spatial pattern to the presence of Bd? and 4) In these limited human-traffic areas, is Bd acting as an epidemic (i.e., with evidence of recent introduction and/or dieoffs due to chytridiomycosis), or as an endemic (present without clinical signs of disease)? Bd was detected on 13 of the 15 bases sampled. Samples from 30 amphibian species were collected (10% of known United States’ species); half (15) tested Bd positive. There was a strong temporal (seasonal) component; in total, 78.5% of all positive samples came in the first (spring/early-summer) sampling period. There was also a strong spatial component—the eleven temperate DoD installations had higher prevalences of Bd infection (20.8%) than the four arid (,60 mm annual precipitation) bases (8.5%). These data support the conclusion that Bd is now widespread, and promote the idea that Bd can today be considered endemic across much of North America, extending from coast-to-coast, with the exception of remote pockets of na¨ıve populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lannoo","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Lovich","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Nanjappa","given":"Priya"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Joseph C."},{"family":"Macallister","given":"Irene"}],"citation-key":"lannoo2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0022211","editor":[{"family":"Browman","given":"Howard"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",7,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e22211","source":"Crossref","title":"Do frogs get their kicks on Route 66?

Following expectations, highly novel climates occurred on tropical non-breeding grounds and the least novel climates occurred on temperate breeding grounds. Contrary to expectations, highly novel climates also occurred within temperate regions during the transition from breeding to autumn migration. This outcome was caused by lower inter-annual climatic variability occurring in combination with stronger warming projections. Thus, migrants are projected to encounter novel climates across the majority of their annual cycle, with a pronounced peak occurring when juveniles are leaving the nest and preparing to embark on their first migratory journey, which may adversely affect their chances of survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"La Sorte","given":"Frank A."},{"family":"Fink","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"lasorte2018","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12951","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"845-856","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Seasonal associations with novel climates for North American migratory bird populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12951","volume":"21"},

Japanese frogs may have evolved mechanisms of immune resistance to pathogens such as Bd. This study characterizes immune genes expressed in various tissues of healthy Japanese Rana frogs.\nResults: We generated transcriptome data sets of skin, spleen and blood from three adult Japanese Ranidae frogs (Japanese brown frog Rana japonica, the montane brown frog Rana ornativentris, and Tago’s brown frog Rana tagoi tagoi) as well as whole body of R. japonica and R. ornativentris tadpoles. From this, we identified tissue- and stagespecific differentially expressed genes; in particular, the spleen was most enriched for immune-related genes. A specific immune gene, major histocompatibility complex class IIB (MHC-IIB), was further characterized due to its role in pathogen recognition. We identified a total of 33 MHC-IIB variants from the three focal species (n = 7 individuals each), which displayed evolutionary signatures related to increased MHC variation, including balancing selection. Our supertyping analyses of MHC-IIB variants from Japanese frogs and previously studied frog species identified potential physiochemical properties of MHC-II that may be important for recognizing and binding chytrid-related antigens.\nConclusions: This is one of the first studies to generate transcriptomic resources for Japanese frogs, and contributes to further understanding the immunogenetic factors associated with resistance to infectious diseases in amphibians such as chytridiomycosis. Notably, MHC-IIB supertyping analyses identified unique functional properties of specific MHC-IIB alleles that may partially contribute to Bd resistance, and such properties provide a springboard for future experimental validation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lau","given":"Quintin"},{"family":"Igawa","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Minei","given":"Ryuhei"},{"family":"Kosch","given":"Tiffany A."},{"family":"Satta","given":"Yoko"}],"citation-key":"lau2017","container-title":"BMC Genomics","DOI":"10.1186/s12864-017-4404-0","ISSN":"1471-2164","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Transcriptome analyses of immune tissues from three Japanese frogs (genus <i>Rana</i>) reveals their utility in characterizing major histocompatibility complex class II","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-4404-0","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"law2021","abstract":"Context It is notoriously difficult to estimate the size of animal populations, especially for cryptic or threatened species that occur in low numbers. Recent advances with acoustic sensors make the detection of animal populations cost effective when coupled with software that can recognise species-specific calls.Aims We assess the potential for acoustic sensors to estimate koala, Phascolarctos cinereus, density, when individuals are not identified, using spatial count models. Sites were selected where previous independent estimates of density were available.Methods We established acoustic arrays at each of five sites representing different environments and densities of koalas in New South Wales. To assess reliability, we compared male koala density estimates derived from spatial count modelling to independently derived estimates for each site.Key results A total 11 312 koala bellows were verified across our five arrays. Koalas were detected at most of our sample locations (96–100% of sensors; n = 130), compared with low detection rates from rapid scat searches at trees near each sensor (scats at <2% of trees searched, n = 889, except one site where scats were present at 69% of trees, n = 129). Independent estimates of koala density at our study areas varied from a minimum of 0.02 male koalas ha−1 to 0.32 ha−1. Acoustic arrays and the spatial count method yielded plausible estimates of male koala density, which, when converted to total koalas (assuming 1:1 sex ratio), were mostly equivalent to independent estimates previously derived for each site. The greatest discrepancy occurred where the acoustic estimate was larger (although within the bounds of uncertainty) than the independent mark–recapture estimate at a fragmented, high koala-density site.Conclusions Spatial count modelling of acoustic data from arrays provides plausible and reliable estimates of koala density and, importantly, associated measures of uncertainty as well as an ability to model spatial variations in density across an array. Caution is needed when applying models to higher-density populations where home ranges overlap extensively and calls are evenly spread across the array.Implications The results add to the opportunities of acoustic methods for wildlife, especially where monitoring of density requires cost-effective repeat surveys.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Law","given":"Brad"},{"family":"Gonsalves","given":"Leroy"},{"family":"Burgar","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Brassil","given":"Traecey"},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Isobel"},{"family":"Wilmott","given":"Lachlan"},{"family":"Madden","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Mella","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Mathew"},{"family":"Krockenberger","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Rus","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Pietsch","given":"Rod"},{"family":"Truskinger","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Eichinski","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Roe","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"law2021","container-title":"Wildlife Research","container-title-short":"Wildl.

  {"id":"law2022","abstract":"Forests on private land have a wide range of uses that span activities such as recreation, primary production and nature conservation. Traditionally, it has been difficult for researchers to access private land to undertake systematic surveys. We used mini-acoustic sensors (Audiomoth) mailed via the postal service to overcome landholder concerns about researchers accessing private property, with a focus on properties used for private native forestry. We surveyed koalas, an iconic threatened marsupial, in north-east New South Wales, Australia using passive acoustics, with repeat surveys over consecutive nights to account for imperfect detection in an occupancy modelling framework. Over 3 years, we surveyed 128 sites and recorded 2,560 male bellows. Detection probability over seven nights was high (>0.79), but varied substantially between years, due to use of different sensors, housings and weather conditions. After accounting for detection probability, modelling revealed that koalas commonly occupied private native forests of the study region (probability of occupancy = 0.58 ± 0.08). Occupancy was modelled against several covariates and it varied with the landscape extent of sealed roads (₋ve), NDVI (₋ve) and a habitat suitability model (+ve, but minor). There was no support for occupancy in private forests to be related to a range of other factors including extent of surrounding cleared land, timber harvesting history, fire and other measured habitat features. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that mini-acoustic recorders mailed to landholders were a highly effective method for assessing koala occupancy, after accounting for variable detection, and the approach could be deployed more widely for a range of species. Private native forests in partly cleared landscapes are commonly occupied by koalas, highlighting that this tenure is crucial for koala conservation and that practices seeking to balance conservation and production should be encouraged. In addition to sensitive habitat management in private forests, sealed road density is a major threat needing to be addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Law","given":"Brad"},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Isobel"},{"family":"Gonsalves","given":"Leroy"},{"family":"Brassil","given":"Traecey"},{"family":"Eichinski","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Truskinger","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Roe","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"law2022","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.14099","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"835-846","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Mini-acoustic sensors reveal occupancy and threats to koalas <i>Phascolarctos cinereus</i> in private native forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.14099","volume":"59"},
  {"id":"lawler1993","abstract":"Interspecific competitors often colonize communities at different times, but few studies have experimentally tested whether the strength of interspecific competition hinges on the order or temporal separation of species' arrivals. We added hatchlings of two sympatric anuran species (Hyla[=Pseudacris] crucifer and Bufo woodhousii) to artificial ponds on three different dates to manipulate the order and temporal separation of their arrival. Measurement of the growth and survival of each species in ponds where the second species arrived simultaneously (day 0), or after a delay of 7 or 14 d, indicated whether differences in the history of introductions affected interspecific competition. Other ponds contained H. crucifer alone, introduced on the same three dates, of B. woodhousii alone, introduced on the first and second date. These provided controls for seasonal differences in performance in the absence of competition from the other anuran species. Introductions of tadpoles at different times produced small differences in growth rates and larval periods when each anuran species occurred alone. In ponds containing both species, differences in the order and temporal separation of introductions had complex effects on the intensity of interspecific competition. When Bufo preceded Hyla, Hyla had prolonged larval periods and reduced mass and growth. When Hyla preceded Bufo, it was unaffected by Bufo. Hyla had no effects on Bufo, whether its introduction preceded or followed the introduction of Bufo. Asymmetric priority effects were not easily explained as a simple size?dependent competitive advantage of earlier arrivals. Early arrival increased the competitive impact of Bufo on Hyla, but failed to generate a competitive effect of Hyla on Bufo. Bufo tadpoles are more active than Hyla, and so may consume resources at higher rates that cannot be offset by a temporal advantage. Competition from Bufo was strongest when Hyla arrived 7 d later, suggesting that Hyla arriving 14 d after Bufo benefited from a longer period of reduced competition after Bufo metamorphosed from the ponds. The natural pattern, where Hyla breeds before or simultaneously with Bufo, permits Hyla to minimize competition from Bufo, while Bufo suffers no measurable cost from the size advantage obtained by competitively weaker Hyla tadpoles. Bufo may be prevented from breeding any earlier in the season by physiological constraints acting on eggs or breeding adults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawler","given":"Sharon P."},{"family":"Morin","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"lawler1993","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1939512","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",1,1]]},"page":"174-182","source":"esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au (Atypon)","title":"Temporal overlap, competition, and priority effects in larval anurans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au/doi/abs/10.2307/1939512","volume":"74"},

During the seven following years, monitoring of the terrestrial vertebrate populations was conducted there. In total, six amphibian species, six reptile species, 142 bird species, and 20 small mammal species were registered. The particular wildfire impact on different vertebrate species was dissimilar. In the first year after the wildfire impact, bird populations in the habitats affected by different wildfire types were similar according to the Sorensen-Chekanovsky’s index. This similarity increased over time. The species richness changed in different directions. At first study years, the abundance of the nesting bird populations increased both in burnt and unburnt sites, while later this parameter decreased a bit and stabilised. The bird populations of the unburnt habitats differ by lower indicators for the last five years. We distinguished the species (e.g. Sylvia communis) recognised as indicators of damaging by fire. These are birds which became abundant in the burnt forest, but were very rarely dominant and less abundant in unburnt forest. Fringilla coelebs was dominant in all habitats studied. For the small mammal communities, the wildfire influence affected a decrease (by 2–3 times) in the abundance and biodiversity indexes, and a change of dominants (from Clethrionomys glareolus to Apodemus flavicollis). ANOVA showed that the fires with a high degree of reliability (0.445; р-level < 1) had a higher impact on the small mammal communities. In amphibians and reptiles, the wildfire caused only a decrease in abundance followed by subsequent recovery without changes in community composition. The most intense postfire changes in terrestrial vertebrate (Tetrapoda) populations were observed within the first five post-fire years. The amphibian and the reptile populations recovered after three post-fire years, while the recovery of bird and small mammal communities noted 4–5 years after the fire.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Lebedinskii","given":"Andrei A."},{"family":"Noskova","given":"Olga S."},{"family":"Dmitriev","given":"Alexander I."}],"citation-key":"lebedinskii2019","container-title":"Nature Conservation Research","DOI":"10.24189/ncr.2019.049","ISSN":"2500008X","issue":"Suppl.1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"45-56","source":"Crossref","title":"Post-fire recovery of terrestrial vertebrates in the Kerzhensky State Nature Biosphere Reserve (Central Volga Region, Russia)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ncr-journal.bear-land.org/article/223","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"lebreton1992","abstract":"The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade-offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capturerecapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture-recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lebreton","given":"Jean-Dominique"},{"family":"Burnham","given":"Kenneth P."},{"family":"Clobert","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"lebreton1992","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.2307/2937171","ISSN":"00129615","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",2]]},"language":"en","page":"67-118","source":"Crossref","title":"Modeling survival and testing biological hypotheses using marked animals: A unified approach with case studies","title-short":"Modeling survival and testing biological hypotheses using marked animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.2307/2937171","volume":"62"},

The growing interest in spatial aspects of population dynamics presently contributes to making multistate models a very promising tool for population biology. We review ® rst the interest and the potential of multistate models, in particular when they are used with individual states as well as geog raphical sites.

M ultistate models also constitute a natural framework for mixtures of information in individual histor y data. Presently, most models can be ® t using program MARK. As an example, we present a canonical model for multisite accession to reproduction, which fully generalizes a classical one-site model. In the generalization proposed, one can estimate simultaneously age-dependent rates of accession to reproduction, natal and breeding dispersal.

Amphibian surveys may require to mark manually individuals, using toe clipping, polymers and pigments, or passive integrated transponders (PIT-tags). Even if ethics committees have recently recommend avoiding toe clipping in amphibians, the use of PIT-tags led to controversial results because low tag retention reported in some studies. Here, we describe a protocol of potentially life-long PIT-tag marking in a protected species, the marbled newt Triturus marmoratus. In addition, we also detailed a second procedure of surgery for the implantation of transmitters needed in radio-tracking surveys. During both procedures, we found that the newt phase (either aquatic or terrestrial) strongly affected the anesthesia duration.

  {"id":"lecoeur2022","abstract":"Demographic buffering and lability have been identified as adaptive strategies to optimise fitness in a fluctuating environment. These are not mutually exclusive, however, we lack efficient methods to measure their relative importance for a given life history. Here, we decompose the stochastic growth rate (fitness) into components arising from nonlinear responses and variance–covariance of demographic parameters to an environmental driver, which allows studying joint effects of buffering and lability. We apply this decomposition for 154 animal matrix population models under different scenarios to explore how these main fitness components vary across life histories. Faster-living species appear more responsive to environmental fluctuations, either positively or negatively. They have the highest potential for strong adaptive demographic lability, while demographic buffering is a main strategy in slow-living species. Our decomposition provides a comprehensive framework to study how organisms adapt to variability through buffering and lability, and to predict species responses to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Le Coeur","given":"Christie"},{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"Nigel G."},{"family":"Salguero-Gómez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Vindenes","given":"Yngvild"}],"citation-key":"lecoeur2022","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/ele.14071","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"2107-2119","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Life history adaptations to fluctuating environments: Combined effects of demographic buffering and lability","title-short":"Life history adaptations to fluctuating environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.14071","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"lemckert2004","abstract":"Low intensity burns within and adjacent to Chaelundi State Forest prompted comparisons of pre- and post- re frog counts for six burnt and six unburnt pond areas. We used a before-andafter control/ impact (BACI) approach to assess whether changes in total frog numbers, number of species and numbers of individuals of ve common species varied signi cantly between the burnt and unburnt sites. Additionally, time since last re, re scar height from last re and maximum re scar height from any re were scored for the vegetation surrounding 17 ponds in the area, and compared to frog counts obtained in November 2001. In the BACI study, the only signi cant source of variation for all analyses was found between the within-season counts, which could be extremely variable. Season, re and the season £ re interaction were not signi cant. A Spearman Rank Correlation found no signi cant associations between counts and re measurements for the 17 ponds. A review of the con dence intervals of our data revealed a low power to detect any effects because withinseason counts varied so greatly. We estimate that a change of six species or 12 frogs per site would be needed to obtain a statistically signi cant result with the type of data collected. We recommend that effort in any future studies be directed to obtaining a much greater number of repeat counts per site/ replicate sites, if such variation were to occur. Another possibility may be the strict control of the timing of surveys to within speci c environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures between 18 and 22 ±C, and/ or rainfall between 10 and 30 mm in the previous 72 hours). Such an approach may reduce variation to more manageable levels.

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an eﬀect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect eﬀects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of eﬀects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-ﬁre way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their ﬂexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates.

CMR designs can be used to address questions in a variety of disciplines including population dynamics, evolutionary ecology, lifehistory, and community ecology. Methodological advances have also enabled investigators to consider designs that include nearly all common sources of CMR data simultaneously. CMR designs have been generalized to account for many assumptions; however, more emphasis needs to placed on use of auxiliary variables to increase precision and address model assumptions.

For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children’s names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions.

These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation.

In addition to recaptures of marked animals, we model ﬁrst captures of animals and losses on capture. The parameter set includes capture probabilities, survival rates, and birth rates. The survival rates and birth rates are treated as a random sample from a bivariate distribution, thus the model explicitly incorporates correlation in these demographic rates. A key feature of the model is that the likelihood function, which includes a CJS model factor, is expressed entirely in terms of identiﬁable parameters; losses on capture can be factored out of the model. Since the computational complexity of classical likelihood methods is prohibitive, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo in a Bayesian analysis.

There is, however, a cost to using the N-mixture models: inference is very sensitive to the model’s assumptions. We consider the effects of three violations of assumptions that might reasonably be expected in practice: double counting, unmodeled variation in population size over time, and unmodeled variation in detection probability over time. These three examples show that small violations of assumptions can lead to large biases in estimation. The violations of assumptions we consider are not only small qualitatively, but are also small in the sense that they are unlikely to be detected using goodness-of-fit tests. In cases where reliable estimates of population size are needed, we encourage investigators to allocate resources to acquiring additional data, such as recaptures of marked individuals, for estimation of detection probabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Link","given":"William A."},{"family":"Schofield","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Barker","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Sauer","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"link2018","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2362","ISSN":"00129658","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","page":"1547-1551","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the robustness of N-mixture models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.2362","volume":"99"},

Nocturnal predators locate prey visually, and prey may adjust their activity to minimise their predation risk. Understanding how native mammals in Australia respond to varying phases of the moon and cloud cover (light) enhances knowledge of factors affecting species’ survival and inference regarding ecological and population survey data. Over a two-year period within a fenced conservation reserve, in south-eastern Australia, with reintroduced native marsupial predator and prey species (eastern barred bandicoot, southern brown bandicoot, long-nosed potoroo, rufous bettong, Tasmanian pademelon, brushtailed rock-wallaby, red-necked wallaby, eastern quoll, spotted-tailed quoll, and naturally occurring swamp wallaby, common brushtail possum, common ringtail possum), we conducted monthly spotlight surveys during different moon phases (full, half and new moon). We found an interaction between cloud cover and moon phase, and an interaction of the two depending on the mammal size and class. Increased activity of prey species corresponded with periods of increasing cloud cover. Predators and medium-sized herbivores were more active during times of low illumination. Our findings suggest that moon phase affects the nocturnal activity of mammal species and that, for prey species, there might be tradeoffs between predation risk and foraging. Our findings have implications for: ecological survey design and interpretation of results for mammal populations across moon phases, understanding predator and prey behaviour and interactions in natural and modified (artificial lighting) ecosystems, and potential nocturnal niche partitioning of species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Linley","given":"G.

  {"id":"lips1998","abstract":"On the basis of surveys conducted between 1991 and 1996, I report a decline of the amphibian fauna at Las Tablas, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. I propose that the reduction in the abundance of Atelopus chiriquiensis and Hyla calypsa, the presence of dead and dying individuals of six species of frogs and salamanders, and changes in population sex ratios of A. chiriquiensis and H. calypsa are evidence for “atypical” population fluctuations. Species with both aquatic eggs and aquatic larvae were most affected (e.g., Rana vibicaria, Hyla rivularis), whereas species with direct development or those that lack tadpoles, such as rainfrogs ( Eleutherodactylus spp.) and some salamanders (e.g., Bolitoglossa minutula), do not seem to have declined in numbers. In light of this evidence and in comparison with other declines in tropical upland Australia, Brazil, and Costa Rica, I conclude that environmental contamination (biotic pathogens or chemicals) or a combination of factors (environmental contamination plus climate change) may be responsible for declines in the amphibian populations at this protected site.

Tomando en cuenta estos datos y comparándolos a las disminuciones observadas en otros sitios montañosos del trópico, concluyo que la contaminación del medio ambiente (causado por un microbio patógeno o químico) o quizás causado por una combinación de factores (contaminación del medio ambiente más cambios del clima) puede ser la causa de la disminución de la población anfibia de este sitio protegido.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."}],"citation-key":"lips1998","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.96359.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"106-117","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Decline of a Tropical Montane Amphibian Fauna","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.96359.x","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"lips2014","abstract":"For the past 17 years, scientists have been compiling a list of amphibian species susceptible to infection by the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), all over the world, with >500 species infected on every continent except Antarctica (Olson et al. 2013). Where Bd has been found, the impacts on amphibians has been one of two types: either Bd arrives into a na€ıve amphibian population followed by a mass die-off and population declines (e.g. Lips et al. 2006), or Bd is present at some moderate prevalence, usually infecting many species but at apparently nonlethal intensities for a long time. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rodriguez et al. (2014) discover that the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil is home to two Bd lineages: the Global Pandemic Lineage (Bd-GPL) – the strain responsible for mass die-offs and population declines – and a lineage endemic to Brazil (Bd-Bz). Even more surprising was that both lineages have been present in this area for the past 100 years, making these the oldest records of Bd infecting amphibians. The team also described a moderate but steady prevalence of ~20% across all sampled anuran families for over 100 years, indicating that Brazil has been in an enzootic disease state for over a century. Most amphibians were infected with Bd-GPL, suggesting this lineage may be a better competitor than Bd-Bz or may be replacing the Bd-Bz lineage. Rodriguez et al. (2014) also detected likely hybridization of the two Bd lineages, as originally described by Schloegel et al. (2012).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"lips2014","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.12651","ISSN":"09621083","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en","page":"747-749","source":"Crossref","title":"A tale of two lineages: unexpected, long-term persistence of the amphibian-killing fungus in Brazil","title-short":"A tale of two lineages","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/mec.12651","volume":"23"},

Using this isolate, we photographed developmental stages on nutrient agar, examined zoospores with transmission electron microscopy, and inoculated test frogs. This inoperculate chytrid develops either monocentrically or colonially and has thread-like rhizoids that arise from single or multiple areas on the developing zoosporangium. The taxonomically important features of the kinetosomal region of the zoospore indicate that this chytrid is a member of the Chytridiales but differs from other chytrids studied with transmission electron microscopy. Its microtubule root, which begins at kinetosome triplets 9-1 and extends parallel to the kinetosome into the aggregation of ribosomes, is distinctive. Histologic examination of test frogs revealed that the pure culture infected the skin of test frogs, whereas the skin of control frogs remained free of infection.

  {"id":"longo2013","abstract":"Genomic studies of the amphibian-killing fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, [Bd]) identified three highly divergent genetic lineages, only one of which has a global distribution. Bd strains within these linages show variable genomic content due to differential loss of heterozygosity and recombination. The current quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) protocol to detect the fungus from amphibian skin swabs targets the intergenic transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region using a TaqMan fluorescent probe specific to Bd. We investigated the consequences of genomic differences in the quantification of ITS1 from eight distinct Bd strains, including representatives from North America, South America, the Caribbean, and Australia. To test for potential differences in amplification, we compared qPCR standards made from Bd zoospore counts for each strain, and showed that they differ significantly in amplification rates. To test potential mechanisms leading to strain differences in qPCR reaction parameters (slope and y-intercept), we: a) compared standard curves from the same strains made from extracted Bd genomic DNA in equimolar solutions, b) quantified the number of ITS1 copies per zoospore using a standard curve made from PCR-amplicons of the ITS1 region, and c) cloned and sequenced PCR-amplified ITS1 regions from these same strains to verify the presence of the probe site in all haplotypes. We found high strain variability in ITS1 copy number, ranging from 10 to 144 copies per single zoospore. Our results indicate that genome size might explain strain differences in ITS1 copy number, but not ITS1 sequence variation because the probe-binding site and primers were conserved across all haplotypes. For standards constructed from uncharacterized Bd strains, we recommend the use of single ITS1 PCR-amplicons as the absolute standard in conjunction with current quantitative assays to inform on copy number variation and provide universal estimates of pathogen zoospore loads from field-caught amphibians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Longo","given":"Ana V."},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"David"},{"family":"Silva Leite","given":"Domingos","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Toledo","given":"Luís Felipe"},{"family":"Mendoza Almeralla","given":"Cinthya"},{"family":"Burrowes","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Zamudio","given":"Kelly R."}],"citation-key":"longo2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0059499","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e59499","source":"Crossref","title":"ITS1 copy number varies among <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> strains: implications for qPCR estimates of infection intensity from field-collected amphibian skin swabs","title-short":"Its1 copy number varies among batrachochytrium dendrobatidis strains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059499","volume":"8"},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lowe","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"lowe2004","container-title":"International Journal of Computer Vision","DOI":"10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94","ISSN":"0920-5691","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11]]},"language":"en","page":"91-110","source":"Crossref","title":"Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94","volume":"60"},
  {"id":"lowe2013","abstract":"Fire has varying effects on species ecology. Knowledge of amphibian responses to fire is particularly limited, with variable responses reported amongst studies. Variability is attributed to differences in fire regimes, sampling methodologies, historical exposure to fire and species traits. Acid frogs, a group of amphibians restricted to acidic coastal heath wetlands of eastern Australia, occupy a discrete ecological niche that is exposed to regular and intense fires. Visual encounter surveys conducted monthly over 2 years revealed different short- and long-term responses to fire in three threatened acid frog species (Litoria olongburensis, Litoria freycineti and Crinia tinnula). Fires altered the thermal properties of habitats by increasing substrate temperature and widening daily temperature ranges. Acid frog populations did not suffer adversely from moderate intensity fires as suitable refuges, including standing water, were available. All species were present shortly after fire with subsequent successful reproduction occurring once wetlands were sufficiently inundated. Time since fire was a strong predictor of landscape scale differences in average relative abundance of acid frogs, yet the relationships varied among species. This highlights the importance of assessing community-wide responses to fire at the landscape scale. The dynamic and adaptive responses observed within acid frog populations demonstrate substantial resilience to fire processes in these fire prone environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lowe","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Castley","given":"J.

We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies.

These biologist-driven extensions are characterized by ambiguity in both species presence and correct state classiﬁcation, caused by imperfect detection. We ﬁrst show the relationships between independently published approaches to the modeling of multistate occupancy. We then extend the pattern-based modeling to the case of sampling over multiple seasons or years in order to estimate state transition probabilities associated with system dynamics. The methodology and its potential for addressing relevant ecological questions are demonstrated using both maximum likelihood (occupancy and successful reproduction dynamics of California Spotted Owl) and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation approaches (changes in relative abundance of green frogs in Maryland).

  {"id":"maigret2019","abstract":"Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) methods are growing in popularity, yet require large starting amounts of high quality DNA. I examined the utility of scale clips, a minimally invasive method of tissue collection for live snakes, as a source of high quality DNA suitable for RADseq. I compared DNA extracted from muscular tissue obtained from roadkilled copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix) and ventral scale clips obtained from live A. contortrix. Much less DNA was extracted from scale clips than from muscular tissue, yet molecular weight and number of sequence reads were not different.

  {"id":"makowski2019","abstract":"Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical signiﬁcance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its ﬂexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “signiﬁcance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many nonfamiliar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist signiﬁcance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientiﬁc reporting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Makowski","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Ben-Shachar","given":"Mattan S."},{"family":"Chen","given":"S.

  {"id":"mammola2020","abstract":"The use of n-dimensional hypervolumes in trait-based ecology is rapidly increasing. By representing the functional space of a species or community as a Hutchinsonian niche, the abstract Euclidean space defined by a set of independent axes corresponding to individuals or species traits, these multidimensional techniques show great potential for the advance of functional ecology theory. In the panorama of existing methods for delineating multidimensional spaces, the r package hypervolume (Global Ecology and Biogeography, 23, 2014, 595–609) is currently the most used. However, functions for calculating the standard set of functional diversity (FD) indices—richness, divergence and regularity—have not been developed within the hypervolume framework yet. This gap is delaying its full exploitation in functional ecology, meanwhile preventing the possibility to compare its performance with that of other methods. We develop a set of functions to calculate FD indices based on n-dimensional hypervolumes, including alpha (richness), beta (and respective components), dispersion, evenness, contribution and originality. Altogether, these indices provide a coherent framework to explore the primary mathematical components of FD within a multidimensional setting. These new functions can work either with hypervolume objects or with raw data (species presence or abundance and their traits) as input data, and are versatile in terms of input parameters and options. These functions are implemented within bat (Biodiversity Assessment Tools), an r package for biodiversity assessments. As a coherent corpus of functional indices based on a common algorithm, it opens the possibility to fully explore the strengths of the Hutchinsonian niche concept in community ecology research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mammola","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Cardoso","given":"Pedro"}],"citation-key":"mammola2020","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13424","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"986-995","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Functional diversity metrics using kernel density n-dimensional hypervolumes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13424","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"mammola2021","abstract":"The use of functional diversity analyses in ecology has grown exponentially over the past two decades, broadening our understanding of biological diversity and its change across space and time. Virtually all ecological sub-disciplines recognise the critical value of looking at species and communities from a functional perspective, and this has led to a proliferation of methods for estimating contrasting dimensions of functional diversity. Differences between these methods and their development generated terminological inconsistencies and confusion about the selection of the most appropriate approach for addressing any particular ecological question, hampering the potential for comparative studies, simulation exercises and meta-analyses. Two general mathematical frameworks for estimating functional diversity are prevailing: those based on dissimilarity matrices (e.g. Rao entropy, functional dendrograms) and those relying on multidimensional spaces, constructed as either convex hulls or probabilistic hypervolumes. We review these frameworks, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an overview of the main R packages performing these calculations. In parallel, we propose a way for organising functional diversity metrics in a unified scheme to quantify the richness, divergence and regularity of species or individuals under each framework. This overview offers a roadmap for confidently approaching functional diversity analyses both theoretically and practically.

However, a sample of tadpoles separated before hatching remained uninfected. We studied the changes in distribution of keratin and sporangia of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in tadpoles during development, by examination of histology sections stained with Ayoub-Shklar stain. Keratin occurred only on the mouthparts during most of tadpole life, and appeared on the feet shortly before metamorphosis. At metamorphosis the keratinized mouthparts are shed before keratin forms on the skin of the body, B. dendrobatidis only occurred on keratinized, stratified epidermis and followed the changes in distribution. There is a rapid redistribution of B. dendrobatidis at metamorphosis leading to fatal infection in M. fascio/atus.

  {"id":"margolis2016","abstract":"Anthropogenic alteration of ecosystem processes confounds forest management and conservation of rare, declining species. Restoration of forest structure and ﬁre hazard reduction are central goals of forest management policy in the western United States, but restoration priorities and treatments have become increasingly contentious. Numerous studies have documented changes in ﬁre regimes, forest stand structure and species composition following a century of ﬁre exclusion in dry, frequent-ﬁre forests of the western U.S. (e.g., ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer). In contrast, wet mixed-conifer forests are thought to have historically burned infrequently with mixed- or high-severity ﬁre—resulting in reduced impacts from ﬁre exclusion and low restoration need—but data are limited. In this study we quantiﬁed the current forest habitat of the federally endangered, terrestrial Jemez Mountains salamander (Plethodon neomexicanus) and compared it to dendroecological reconstructions of historical habitat (e.g., stand structure and composition), and ﬁre regime parameters along a gradient from upper ponderosa pine to wet mixed-conifer forests. We found that current ﬁre-free intervals in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat (116–165 years) are signiﬁcantly longer than historical intervals, even in wet mixed-conifer forests. Historical mean ﬁre intervals ranged from 10 to 42 years along the forest gradient. Low-severity ﬁres were historically dominant across all forest types (92 of 102 ﬁres). Although some mixed- or highseverity ﬁre historically occurred at 67% of the plots over the last four centuries, complete mortality within 1.0 ha plots was rare, and asynchronous within and among sites. Climate was an important driver of temporal variability in ﬁre severity, such that mixed- and high-severity ﬁres were associated with more extreme drought than low-severity ﬁres. Tree density in dry conifer forests historically ranged from open (90 trees haÀ1) to moderately dense (400 trees haÀ1), but has doubled on average since ﬁre exclusion. Inﬁll of ﬁre-sensitive tree species has contributed to the conversion of historically dry mixedconifer to wet mixed-conifer forest. We conclude that low-severity ﬁre, which has been absent for over a century, was a critical ecosystem process across the forest gradient in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat, and thus is an important element of ecosystem restoration, resilience, and rare species recovery.

  {"id":"markle2020","abstract":"The suitability of overwintering habitat in response to temporal fluctuations in winter temperatures and water table position, and variability in timing and intensity of snowfall and rainfall is critical to informing management strategies for climate-sensitive species such as the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus). Important subterranean conditions contributing to the suitability of overwintering habitat for S. catenatus includes the availability of an unflooded space and temperatures above 0 °C which is conceptualized as the resilience zone. Here, we show that the timing and duration of resilience zone loss varies between years and among sites in response to variable weather conditions. Peatland habitat occupied by snakes lost the resilience zone fewer times and for shorter durations than unconfirmed habitat. In some cases occupied habitat continuously provided a resilience zone, suggesting that snakes may only be able to tolerate short periods of unsuitable conditions. As expected, larger precipitation events resulted in greater reduction of the resilience zone size. In particular, rain on snow events resulted in the greatest change in resilience zone size and could increase the risk of mortality events. With extreme weather-related events predicted to increase with climate change, long-term conservation of climate-sensitive species should focus on protecting habitats that are naturally resilient to changing and variable weather conditions and identifying vulnerable habitats that would benefit from additional research on adaptive management strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Markle","given":"C.

Experimental infections have shown species-speciﬁc and temperature-dependent frog responses to Bd infection. Although Bd infection may be eliminated by housing amphibians at temperatures above those tolerated by the fungus, the question of whether frogs can eliminate infection under more favorable conditions remains unanswered. Repeated diagnostics using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt–PCR) assays of postmetamorphic individuals at 28, 38, 45, 53, and 62 days after exposure demonstrated that Hypsiboas crepitans is able to clear infection within a few weeks at 23°C. Thus, we demonstrate a temperature-independent and likely immunological mechanism for the clearance of Bd in a resistant amphibian species. Future studies are needed to determine the generality of this mechanism among amphibians and to describe the immune factors affecting different outcomes of Bd exposure including resistance to infection, tolerance of infection, and clearance of infection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Márquez","given":"M."},{"family":"Nava-González","given":"F."},{"family":"Sánchez","given":"D."},{"family":"Calcagno","given":"M."},{"family":"Lampo","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"marquez2010","container-title":"EcoHealth","DOI":"10.1007/s10393-010-0350-x","ISSN":"1612-9202, 1612-9210","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"language":"en","page":"380-388","source":"Crossref","title":"Immmunological clearance of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection at a pathogen-optimal temperature in the hylid frog <i>Hypsiboas crepitans</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10393-010-0350-x","volume":"7"},

The establishment of B. dendrobatidis free, stable, amphibian captive breeding colonies is one of the emergency measures that is being taken to save threatened amphibian species from extinction. For this purpose, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing and the development of efficient and safe treatment protocols are required. In this study, we evaluated the use of amphotericin B and voriconazole to treat chytridiomycosis in amphibians. The concentration at which the growth of five tested B. dendrobatidis strains was inhibited was 0.8 μg/ml for amphotericin B and 0.0125 μg/ml for voriconazole. To completely eliminate a mixture of sporangia and zoospores of strain IA042 required 48 h of exposure to 8 μg/ml of amphotericin B or 10 days to 1.25 μg/ml of voriconazole. Zoospores were killed within 0.5 h by 0.8 μg/ml of amphotericin B, but even after 24 h exposure to 1.25 μg/ml of voriconazole they remained viable. Amphotericin B was acutely toxic for Alytes muletensis tadpoles at 8 μg/ml, whereas toxic side effects were not noticed during a seven-day exposure to voriconazole at concentrations as high as 12.5 μg/ml. The voriconazole concentrations remained stable in water during this exposure period. On the basis of this data, experimentally inoculated postmetamorphic Alytes cisternasii were sprayed once daily for 7 days with a 1.25 μg/ml solution of voriconazole in water which eliminated the B. dendrobatidis infection from all treated animals. Finally, treatment of a naturally infected colony of poison dart frogs (Dendrobatidae) using this protocol, combined with environmental disinfection, cleared the infection from the colony.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Martel","given":"A."},{"family":"Van Rooij","given":"P."},{"family":"Vercauteren","given":"G."},{"family":"Baert","given":"K."},{"family":"Van Waeyenberghe","given":"L."},{"family":"Debacker","given":"P."},{"family":"Garner","given":"T.

  {"id":"matthe2017","abstract":"Photographic capture–recapture is a valuable tool for obtaining demographic information on wildlife populations due to its noninvasive nature and cost-­effectiveness. Recently, several computer-­aided photo-­matching algorithms have been developed to more efficiently match images of unique individuals in databases with thousands of images. However, the identification accuracy of these algorithms can severely bias estimates of vital rates and population size. Therefore, it is important to understand the performance and limitations of state-­of-­the-­art photo-­matching algorithms prior to implementation in capture–recapture studies involving possibly thousands of images. Here, we compared the performance of four photo-­matching algorithms; Wild-­ID, I3S Pattern+, APHIS, and AmphIdent using multiple amphibian databases of varying image quality. We measured the performance of each algorithm and evaluated the performance in relation to database size and the number of matching images in the database. We found that algorithm performance differed greatly by algorithm and image database, with recognition rates ranging from 100% to 22.6% when limiting the review to the 10 highest ranking images. We found that recognition rate degraded marginally with increased database size and could be improved considerably with a higher number of matching images in the database. In our study, the pixel-­based algorithm of AmphIdent exhibited superior recognition rates compared to the other approaches. We recommend carefully evaluating algorithm performance prior to using it to match a complete database. By choosing a suitable matching algorithm, databases of sizes that are unfeasible to match “by eye” can be easily translated to accurate individual capture histories necessary for robust demographic estimates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Matthé","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Sannolo","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Winiarski","given":"Kristopher"},{"family":"Spitzen-van der Sluijs","given":"Annemarieke"},{"family":"Goedbloed","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Steinfartz","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Stachow","given":"Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"matthe2017","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.3140","ISSN":"20457758","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8]]},"language":"en","page":"5861-5872","source":"Crossref","title":"Comparison of photo-matching algorithms commonly used for photographic capture-recapture studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.3140","volume":"7"},

Studies of fire in the southern Appalachian Mountains (USA) have documented few effects on reptiles and amphibians. However, these studies were conducted after only one fire and for only a short time (1–3 yr) after the fire. From mid-May to mid-August 2006 and 2007, we used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps to capture reptiles and amphibians in a control and 3 replicated fuel-reduction treatments: 1) twice-burned (2003 and 2006), 2) mechanical understory cut (2002), and 3) mechanical understory cut (2002) followed by 2 burns (2003 and 2006). We captured fewer salamanders in mechanical + twice-burned treatment areas than in twice-burned and control treatment areas, but we captured more lizards in mechanical + twice-burned treatment areas than in other treatment areas. Higher lizard captures in mechanical + twice-burned treatment areas likely was related to increased ground temperatures and greater thermoregulatory opportunities. Higher and more variable ground temperatures and faster drying of remaining litter and duff may have led to fewer salamander captures in mechanical + twice-burned treatment areas. Our longer term results, after 2 prescribed burns, differ from shorter term results. After one prescribed burn at the same site, eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) captures were greater in mechanical + burn treatment areas but salamander captures did not differ among treatment areas. Our results indicate that multiple ( 2) fuel-reduction treatments that decrease canopy cover may benefit lizards but negatively affect salamanders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Matthews","given":"Charlotte E."},{"family":"Moorman","given":"Christopher E."},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Cathryn H."},{"family":"Waldrop","given":"Thomas A."}],"citation-key":"matthews2010","container-title":"The Journal of Wildlife Management","DOI":"10.1111/j.1937-2817.2010.tb01251.x","ISSN":"0022541X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1301-1310","source":"Crossref","title":"Response of reptiles and amphibians to repeated fuel reduction treatments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1937-2817.2010.tb01251.x","volume":"74"},

One hypothesis about competitionÕs contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental ﬁltering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to reﬁne expectations for how species relatedness inﬂuences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayfield","given":"Margaret M."},{"family":"Levine","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"mayfield2010","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01509.x","ISSN":"1461023X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1085-1093","source":"Crossref","title":"Opposing effects of competitive exclusion on the phylogenetic structure of communities: Phylogeny and coexistence","title-short":"Opposing effects of competitive exclusion on the phylogenetic structure of communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01509.x","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"mccallum2005","abstract":"Although there is considerable evidence to support the hypothesis that the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is the primary agent responsible for widespread declines in amphibian populations, particularly rainforest frog populations in Australia and Central America, I argue the case has not yet been made conclusively. Few specimens were collected at the time of population declines, so it may never be possible to conclusively determine their cause. It remains unclear whether the pathogen is novel where declines have occurred. Although it is not necessary that the infection be novel for it to be implicated in declines, if a preexisting pathogen has only recently caused extinctions, cofactors must be important. Whether the pattern of outbreaks represents a “wave” of extinctions is unclear, but if it does, the rate of spread in Australia is implausibly high for a waterborne pathogen, given the most likely estimates of epidemiological parameters. Although B. dendrobatidis is an amphibian pathogen according to Koch’s postulates, the postulates are neither necessary nor sufficient criteria to identify a pathogen. The following key pieces of information are necessary to better understand the impact of this fungus on frog communities: better knowledge of the means and rate of transmission under field conditions, prevalence of infection among frog populations, as distinct from morbid individuals, and the effect of the fungus on frogs in the wild. It is crucial to determine whether there are strains of the fungus with differing pathogenicity to particular frog species and whether host-pathogen coevolution has occurred or is occurring. Recently developed diagnostic tools bring into reach the possibility of addressing these questions and thus developing appropriate strategies to manage frog communities that may be affected by this fungus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish"}],"citation-key":"mccallum2005","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00217.x","ISSN":"0888-8892, 1523-1739","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1421-1430","source":"Crossref","title":"Inconclusiveness of chytridiomycosis as the agent in widespread frog declines","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00217.x","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"mcclintock2010","abstract":"The recent surge in the development and application of species occurrence models has been associated with an acknowledgment among ecologists that species are detected imperfectly due to observation error. Standard models now allow unbiased estimation of occupancy probability when false negative detections occur, but this is conditional on no false positive detections and sufﬁcient incorporation of explanatory variables for the false negative detection process. These assumptions are likely reasonable in many circumstances, but there is mounting evidence that false positive errors and detection probability heterogeneity may be much more prevalent in studies relying on auditory cues for species detection (e.g., songbird or calling amphibian surveys). We used ﬁeld survey data from a simulated calling anuran system of known occupancy state to investigate the biases induced by these errors in dynamic models of species occurrence. Despite the participation of expert observers in simpliﬁed ﬁeld conditions, both false positive errors and site detection probability heterogeneity were extensive for most species in the survey. We found that even low levels of false positive errors, constituting as little as 1% of all detections, can cause severe overestimation of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. Further, unmodeled detection probability heterogeneity induced substantial underestimation of occupancy and overestimation of colonization and local extinction probabilities. Completely spurious relationships between species occurrence and explanatory variables were also found. Such misleading inferences would likely have deleterious implications for conservation and management programs. We contend that all forms of observation error, including false positive errors and heterogeneous detection probabilities, must be incorporated into the estimation framework to facilitate reliable inferences about occupancy and its associated vital rate parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"McClintock","given":"Brett T."},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Larissa L."},{"family":"Pollock","given":"Kenneth H."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Theodore R."}],"citation-key":"mcclintock2010","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/09-1287.1","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8]]},"language":"en","page":"2446-2454","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unmodeled observation error induces bias when inferring patterns and dynamics of species occurrence via aural detections","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/09-1287.1","volume":"91"},

We demonstrate how recent developments incorporating observation error through repeated sampling extend quite naturally to hierarchical spatial models of disease effects, prevalence, and dynamics in natural systems. A highly pathogenic strain of avian inﬂuenza virus in migratory waterfowl and a pathogenic fungus recently implicated in the global loss of amphibian biodiversity are used as motivating examples.

Owing to the inherent difﬁculty of empirical ﬁeld studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or ‘hidden’. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, HMMs have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their speciﬁc systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"McClintock","given":"Brett T."},{"family":"Langrock","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Gimenez","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Cam","given":"Emmanuelle"},{"family":"Borchers","given":"David L."},{"family":"Glennie","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Toby A."}],"citation-key":"mcclintock2020","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol.

A recent study addressed the relationship between the time since last ﬁre (TSF) and resident amphibians and reptiles in rosemary bald, one Florida Scrub habitat type. This is a parallel study in another Florida Scrub habitat type, scrubby ﬂatwoods, at Archbold Biological Station (ABS), Lake Placid, Florida, USA. We installed 36 400-m2 enclosures (four burn units within each of three TSF categories X 3 replicates per burn unit) at ABS. Bucket trap sampling, within and outside the enclosures, occurred during the spring and late summer in 2007 and 2008. Ten environmental variables that reﬂect differences in the biotic and abiotic conditions of the microhabitats associated with different TSF were surveyed. Eleven species of reptiles and six species of amphibians were captured. Three lizard species together accounted for > 95% of the reptile captures, and two toad species together accounted for > 96% of the amphibian captures. Abundance of the Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi Stejneger) was highest in long-unburned areas, probably because of the accumulated litter; but abundances of the other two lizard species did not show a relationship with TSF. Differences in relative abundances of species between sampling years may be a function of the difference in rainfall. Despite substantial variation in sampling methods between this study and the previous one, the herpetofaunal composition of the two habitat types were found to be similar; differences in diversity between them was attributable mostly to differences in relative abundances. Species inhabiting the Florida Scrub ecosystem respond differently to TSF: the federally-listed Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens Bosc), for example, requires more frequent burning than appears to be the case for the Florida Sand Skink. A land management plan of stochastic return intervals and spatial variation of high-intensity ﬁres to maintain a mosaic landscape would be ideal; but management options for maintaining the diversity of all species inhabiting the Florida scrub ecosystem are limited, because of the generally small size of remaining habitat patches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"McCoy","given":"Earl D."},{"family":"Britt","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Catenazzi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Mushinsky","given":"Henry R."}],"citation-key":"mccoy2013","container-title":"Natural Areas Journal","DOI":"10.3375/043.033.0310","ISSN":"0885-8608, 2162-4399","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","page":"316-326","source":"Crossref","title":"Fire and herpetofaunal diversity in the Florida scrub ecosystem","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3375/043.033.0310","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"mcdonald2005","abstract":"In the early 1990s stream-associated amphibian populations in tropical upland North Queensland experienced severe declines resulting in extinction of three species, local elimination of four species, marked reductions in one species and apparently no declines in other species, Chytridiomycosis, a disease due to the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochylrium dendrobatidis, was the likely cause of this epidemic. We conducted a monitoring study for chytridiomycosis in four species of frogs in North Queensland from October 1998 to October 2002 by collecting specimens in the field and using histology of removed digits to diagnose chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis was diagnosed in 112 (7,1%) of the 1 578 specimens and prevalence was significantly associated with season and altitude, with higher prevalences in winter and above 300 metres altitude. A multivariate model adjusting for potential confounding effects arising from the sampling process demonstrated a significant decline in the time trend of prevalence of chytridiomycosis. The study supports the hypothesis that B. dendrobatidis becomes endemic after the initial epidemic wave. Since the surviving species of stream-associated frog, Litoria genimaculata, has increased to pre-decline numbers, the decline in prevalence of chytridiomycosis is evidence of a changed pathogen-host relationship. The reasons for this change are speculative but could be due to an increase in innate host resistance in response to selection pressure by B. dendrobatidis or to lower rainfall associated with an EI Nino effect. These findings justify management strategies that assist susceptible amphibian species to survive an initial epidemic wave of chytridiomycosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"McDonald","given":"K.

Recruitment exhibited strong negative density‐dependence, but was not influenced by disease, while adult survival was density independent but declined with increasing prevalence of diseased individuals.

  {"id":"mcdonald2018","abstract":"To effectively manage landscapes that support species with complex life cycles, managers should consider how current practices affect habitats these organisms rely on in each life stage. Prescribed fire is a landscape level disturbance that may alter both aquatic and terrestrial habitat characteristics. However, our knowledge of the effects of fire on amphibians is primarily limited to adult responses in terrestrial habitats. Here we present an integrated approach to test the response of Cope’s Gray Treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) to fire across terrestrial and aquatic habitats by examining responses in tadpole performance and survivorship, adult abundance, and oviposition choice. In a common garden experiment, tadpoles reared with unburned leaf litter grew much faster those in pools with burned litter. To determine how fire in terrestrial and aquatic habitats acts to shape oviposition choice, we embedded aquatic mesocosms containing a substrate of either burned or unburned leaf litter within burned and unburned terrestrial plots. Observed oviposition was an order of magnitude higher in unburned terrestrial plots, regardless of the aquatic leaf litter treatment. This trend was not driven by differences in adult abundance in burned and unburned plots. Our findings are consistent with a scenario where adult treefrogs use terrestrial cues to preferentially breed in aquatic sites in unburned landscapes where tadpoles also experience greater growth. These insights highlight the value of adopting a multi-scale integrative approach that links stage and habitat specific effects on abundance, behavior, and performance to understanding the effects of anthropogenic and natural stressors on animal with complex life cycles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"McDonald","given":"Logan A."},{"family":"Grayson","given":"Kristine L."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Haley A."},{"family":"Vonesh","given":"James R."}],"citation-key":"mcdonald2018","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.008","ISSN":"0378-1127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,15]]},"page":"394-402","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Stage-specific effects of fire: Effects of prescribed burning on adult abundance, oviposition habitat selection, and larval performance of Cope’s Gray Treefrog (<i>Hyla chrysoscelis</i>)","title-short":"Stage-specific effects of fire","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112718302329","volume":"430"},

In 1994,Taronga Zoo, Sydney, established a captive population of bell frogs, after obtaining a small number of frogs from a suburban site planned for development. Our aim was to maintain and breed bell frogs in captivity and to provide progeny for release at suitable sites in order to establish new and self-sustaining populations. The program later expanded to include bell frogs from two other locations in New South Wales. Successful breeding has been regularly achieved and fourth generation captive-bred individuals have been released.Approximately 20,000 tadpoles and metamorph frogs were provided for release at five sites between 1996 and 2004, although no new populations of bell frogs were established. Education has been another key component of this program at Taronga Zoo, with school and community groups actively involved in releases, monitoring and habitat restoration. One outcome of this component was the creation of an interactive CD-ROM, to provide an educational resource on frog conservation, that was distributed to schools and various community groups Australia-wide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"McFadden","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Harlow","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hobcroft","given":"Dion"},{"family":"Webb","given":"Candice"},{"family":"Ward-Fear","given":"Georgia"}],"citation-key":"mcfadden2008","container-title":"Australian Zoologist","DOI":"10.7882/AZ.2008.006","ISSN":"0067-2238","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10]]},"language":"en","page":"291-296","source":"Crossref","title":"A review of the green and golden bell frog <i>Litoria aurea</i> breeding program at Taronga Zoo","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://publications.rzsnsw.org.au/doi/10.7882/AZ.2008.006","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"mchugh2019","abstract":"Australia has had the highest rate of mammal extinctions in the past two centuries when compared to other continents. Frequently cited threats include habitat loss and fragmentation, changed fire regimes and the impact of introduced predators, namely the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral cat (Felis catus). Recent studies suggest that Australia's top predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), may have a suppressive effect on fox populations but not on cat populations. The landscape of fear hypothesis proposes that habitat used by prey species comprises high to low risk patches for foraging as determined by the presence and ubiquity of predators within the ecosystem. This results in a landscape of risky versus safe areas for prey species. We investigated the influence of habitat and its interaction with predatory mammals on the occupancy of medium‐sized mammals with a focus on threatened macropodid marsupials (the longnosed potoroo [Potorous tridactylous] and red‐legged pademelon [Thylogale stigmatica]). We assumed that differential use of habitats would reflect trade‐offs between food and safety. We predicted that medium‐sized mammals would prefer habitats for foraging that reduce the risk of predation but that predators would have a positive relationship with medium‐sized mammals. We variously used data from 298 camera trap sites across nine conservation reserves in subtropical Australia. Both dingoes and feral cats were broadly distributed, whilst the red fox was rare. Long‐nosed potoroos had a strong positive association with dense ground cover, consistent with using habitat complexity to escape predation. Red‐legged pademelons showed a preference for open ground cover, consistent with a reliance on rapid bounding to escape predation. Dingoes preferred areas of open ground cover whereas feral cats showed no specific habitat preference. Dingoes were positively associated with longnosed potoroos whilst feral cats were positively associated with red‐legged pademelons. Our study highlights the importance of habitat structure to these threatened mammals and also the need for more detailed study of their interactions with their predators.","author":[{"family":"McHugh","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Goldingay","given":"Ross L."},{"family":"Link","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Letnic","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"mchugh2019","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"18","source":"Zotero","title":"Habitat and introduced predators influence the occupancy of small threatened macropods in subtropical Australia","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"mcknight2019","abstract":"Recent decades have seen the emergence and spread of numerous infectious diseases, often with severe negative consequences for wildlife populations. Nevertheless, many populations survive the initial outbreaks, and even undergo recoveries. Unfortunately, the long‐term effects of these outbreaks on host population genetics are poorly understood; to increase this understanding, we examined the population genetics of two species of rainforest frogs (Litoria nannotis and Litoria serrata) that have largely recovered from a chytridiomycosis outbreak at two national parks in the Wet Tropics of northern Australia. At the wetter, northern park there was little evidence of decreased genetic diversity in either species, and all of the sampled sites had high minor allele frequencies (mean MAF = 0.230–0.235), high heterozygosity (0.318–0.325), and few monomorphic markers (1.4%–4.0%); however, some recovered L. nannotis populations had low Ne values (59.3–683.8) compared to populations that did not decline during the outbreak (1,537.4–1,756.5). At the drier, southern park, both species exhibited lower diversity (mean MAF = 0.084–0.180; heterozygosity = 0.126–0.257; monomorphic markers = 3.7%–43.5%; Ne = 18.4–676.1). The diversity patterns in this park matched habitat patterns, with both species having higher diversity levels and fewer closely related individuals at sites with higher quality habitat. These patterns were more pronounced for L. nannotis, which has lower dispersal rates than L. serrata. These results suggest that refugia with high quality habitat are important for retaining genetic diversity during disease outbreaks, and that gene flow following disease outbreaks is important for re‐establishing diversity in populations where it was reduced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"McKnight","given":"Donald T."},{"family":"Lal","given":"Monal M."},{"family":"Bower","given":"Deborah S."},{"family":"Schwarzkopf","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Zenger","given":"Kyall R."}],"citation-key":"mcknight2019","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.15108","ISSN":"0962-1083, 1365-294X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"The return of the frogs: The importance of habitat refugia in maintaining diversity during a disease outbreak","title-short":"The return of the frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15108"},

We also do not have predictive functions for the abundance of Bd in mouthparts and limbs as tadpoles develop or for the relationship between keratin and Bd abundance. Hence, researchers presently have little guidance on where to sample developing amphibians to maximize Bd detection, which could affect the accuracy of prevalence and abundance estimates for this deadly pathogen. Here, we show consistency in the timing of the transition of Bd from mouthparts to hind limbs across two frog species (Osteopilus septentrionalis and Mixophyes fasciolatus). Keratin and Bd simultaneously declined from the mouthparts starting at approximately Gosner stage 40. However, keratin on the hindlimbs began to appear at approximately stage 38 but, on average, Bd was not detectable on the hindlimbs until approximately stage 40, suggesting a lag between keratin and Bd arrival.

  {"id":"mcmahon2019","abstract":"The mass decline of amphibian populations poses a serious threat to global biodiversity and ecosystem stability. The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has contributed to the extirpation and extinction of hundreds of amphibian species worldwide. Bd produces potentially damaging metabolites during the host infection process that may affect amphibian growth and development, even in the absence of infection. In this experiment, Cuban tree frog Osteopilus septentrionalis tadpoles and adults were exposed once to either artificial spring water (ASW) or Bd metabolites (n = 31 tadpoles per treatment and n = 20 and 30 adults per treatment, respectively). Tadpoles exposed to Bd metabolites alone developed faster than those exposed to ASW; however, there was no difference in tadpole length, weight change, or mortality between treatments. Despite the faster developmental speed, metabolite exposure did not reduce tadpole weight or length (compared at Gosner stages 27, 29, and 31). There was no effect of treatment on adult size or mortality. These results indicate that both tadpole and adult O. septentrionalis do not appear to be negatively impacted by exposure to non-infectious Bd-contaminated water. In fact, tadpoles developed faster when exposed to metabolites and were of equal size as those in their stage cohort, implying a potential long-term benefit if faster development allows them to leave Bd-infected waters sooner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"McMahon","given":"Ta"},{"family":"Laggan","given":"Na"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Mn"}],"citation-key":"mcmahon2019","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao03401","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,19]]},"language":"en","page":"251-255","source":"Crossref","title":"Metabolites produced by <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> alter development in tadpoles, but not growth or mortality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v135/n3/p251-255/","volume":"135"},

We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm—and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it—as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to “ban” p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures.

  {"id":"messerman","abstract":"Integral projection models (IPMs) can estimate the population dynamics of species for which both discrete life stages and continuous variables influence demographic rates. Stochastic IPMs for imperiled species, in turn, can facilitate population viability analyses (PVAs) to guide conservation decision-making. Biphasic amphibians are globally distributed, often highly imperiled, and ecologically well-suited to the IPM approach. Herein, we present a stochastic size- and stage-structured IPM for a biphasic amphibian, the U.S. federally threatened California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense; CTS). This Bayesian model reveals that CTS population dynamics show greatest elasticity to changes in juvenile and metamorph growth, and that populations are likely to experience rapid growth at low density. We integrated this IPM with climatic drivers of CTS demography to develop a PVA, and examined CTS extinction risk under the primary threats of habitat loss and climate change. The PVA indicated that long-term viability is possible with surprisingly high (20–50%) terrestrial mortality, but simultaneously identified likely minimum terrestrial buffer requirements of 600–1,000 m while accounting for numerous parameter uncertainties through the Bayesian framework. These analyses underscore the value of stochastic and Bayesian IPMs for understanding both climate-dependent taxa and those with cryptic life histories (e.g., biphasic amphibians) in service of ecological discovery and biodiversity conservation. In addition to providing guidance for CTS recovery, the contributed IPM and PVA supply a framework for applying these tools to investigations of ecologically-similar species.

  {"id":"mester2015a","abstract":"Ecosystem management often aims to maintain a diversity of habitats to beneﬁt a large number of species within a landscape. We studied the effects of wetland management by low-intensity cattle-grazing and late-summer burning on marsh vegetation and globally declining anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) in a previously homogeneous reedbed. Burning effectively removed old reed and increased the variability of reed cover and marsh vegetation by the next spring. However, reed grew back strong in areas burned 2 or 3 years before the study, indicating that ﬁre rejuvenates reedbeds. In contrast, cattle-grazing kept reed cover homogeneously low and created open water surfaces. The number of amphibian species and individuals decreased with mean reed cover and old reed density, and increased with variability in reed cover. Correspondingly, amphibian richness and counts were greatest in newly burned areas the next spring. In contrast, a year later, richness and counts were greatest in grazed-only areas, with large decreases in newly burned and control areas. Our results suggest that combined management with grazing and burning can create different habitat patches, some of which will be optimal for amphibians in one year, whereas other patches may become suitable in a subsequent year when successional changes alter previously optimal patches. To maximise optimal habitats, mosaic management should repeat burning once every 2 or 3 years in a rotational manner, and also maintain low-intensity cattle-grazing, which controls reeds and beneﬁts amphibians more sustainably. Our study supports spatiotemporally varied management to facilitate habitat heterogeneity and complexity in dynamic landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mester","given":"Béla"},{"family":"Szalai","given":"Mónika"},{"family":"Mérő","given":"Thomas Oliver"},{"family":"Puky","given":"Miklós"},{"family":"Lengyel","given":"Szabolcs"}],"citation-key":"mester2015a","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2015.09.030","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"237-246","source":"Crossref","title":"Spatiotemporally variable management by grazing and burning increases marsh diversity and benefits amphibians: A field experiment","title-short":"Spatiotemporally variable management by grazing and burning increases marsh diversity and benefits amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000632071530121X","volume":"192"},

An alternative, non-invasive method to identify individuals is to utilize the patterns of their natural body markings. However, the use of pattern mapping is not yet widespread, mainly because it is considered time consuming, particularly in large populations and/or long-term CMR studies. Here we explore the use of pattern mapping for the identiﬁcation of adult individuals in the alpine (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and smooth (Lissotriton vulgaris) newts (Amphibia, Salamandridae), using the freely available, opensource software Wild-ID. Our photographic datasets comprised nearly 4000 captured animals’ images, taken during a 3-year period. The spot patterns of individual newts of both species did not change through time, and were suﬃciently varied to allow their individual identiﬁcation, even in the larger datasets. The pattern-recognition algorithm of Wild-ID was highly successful in identifying individual newts in both species. Our ﬁndings indicate that pattern mapping can be successfully employed for the identiﬁcation of individuals in large populations of a broad range of animals that exhibit natural markings. The signiﬁcance of pattern-mapping is accentuated in CMR studies that aim in obtaining longterm information on the demography and population dynamics of species of conservation interest, such as many amphibians facing population declines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mettouris","given":"Onoufrios"},{"family":"Megremis","given":"George"},{"family":"Giokas","given":"Sinos"}],"citation-key":"mettouris2016","container-title":"Ecological Research","DOI":"10.1007/s11284-016-1346-y","ISSN":"0912-3814, 1440-1703","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"language":"en","page":"483-489","source":"Crossref","title":"A newt does not change its spots: using pattern mapping for the identification of individuals in large populations of newt species","title-short":"A newt does not change its spots","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1007/s11284-016-1346-y","volume":"31"},

Despite the extensive use of artiﬁcial refuges in mesic environments, their effectiveness for detecting amphibians in temperate zones has rarely been examined. We compared amphibian detection probabilities between two survey methods; active searches of natural habitat and artiﬁcial refuges of three different types (corrugated steel, rooﬁng tiles and timber railway sleepers). Our study area included ﬁve bioregions encompassing a 1180-km latitudinal gradient across a modiﬁed, temperate eucalypt woodland vegetation community in south-eastern Australia. We deployed 14 778 artiﬁcial refuges in terrestrial environments, within patches of remnant vegetation, and collected presence and abundance data on herpetofauna between 1999 and 2017. We used Bayesian logistic regression to identify the most effective survey method for detecting frog species across all bioregions. We modelled frog detections by ﬁtting survey method, time since refuge deployment and rainfall prior to each survey. We detected 3970 individuals from 18 frog species. Overall, we found active searches and timber substrates most effective for detecting a broad range of species, although detection rates were driven by the numerically abundant spotted marsh frog Limnodynastes tasmaniensis. Timber refuges were effective for detecting several burrowing species, whereas active searches were effective at detecting habitat generalists. Quadratic effects of rainfall prior to survey as opposed to linear effects of time since artiﬁcial refuge placement was important in explaining frog detection rates in some bioregions. Active searches, timber railway sleepers and sheets of corrugated steel provide complimentary survey methods for detecting amphibians, although detection rates are inﬂuenced by rainfall patterns. Artiﬁcial refuges provide a time-effective and standardized method for studying amphibians in their non-breeding terrestrial environment and should be incorporated into future surveys and biodiversity monitoring programmes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Michael","given":"Damian R."},{"family":"Blanchard","given":"Wade"},{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Lindenmayer","given":"David B."}],"citation-key":"michael2019","container-title":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/aec.12677","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","page":"327-338","source":"Crossref","title":"Comparative use of active searches and artificial refuges to detect amphibians in terrestrial environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/aec.12677","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"michaels2014","abstract":"Due to the importance of ex-situ components of the response to the on-going amphibian extinction crisis, the numbers of captive amphibian species and populations is growing. However, ex-situ projects are currently often poorly supported by knowledge of the captive husbandry requirements of individual amphibian species, many of which are being taken into captivity for the first time. Natural history data and measurements of wild environmental parameters are critical in designing appropriate captive environments, but are absent for the majority of species held in captivity. This has resulted in the failure of some exsitu projects and is likely to affect many future initiatives. Publication biases away from natural history and amphibian-specific research, the inaccessibility of data in academic literature for conservation institutions and lack of time for preparative surveys before ‘rescue’ attempts are largely responsible for this data deficit. In many cases, conservation groups must collect their own data where existing information is insufficient. We suggest important parameters to record in the field and discuss the importance of considering the microclimates in which wild amphibians live when determining the methodology of recording parameters. Furthermore, we highlight the important role that public databases should fulfil to store and disseminate data. All in all, this perspective piece demonstrates the need for natural history data and outlines a road map for their efficient collection and for their practical integration into conservation programmes.","author":[{"family":"Michaels","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Gini","given":"Beatrice F."},{"family":"Preziosi","given":"Richard F."}],"citation-key":"michaels2014","container-title":"Herpetological Journal","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"135-145","source":"Zotero","title":"The importance of natural history and species-specific approaches in amphibian ex-situ conservation","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

Although viruses in the genus Ranavirus are globally widespread, and multiple virus species or strains likely co-occur in nature, no studies have examined how co-exposure affects infection dynamics in larval amphibians. We exposed individual northern red-legged frog Rana aurora larvae to 2 species of ranavirus, namely Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), frog virus 3 (FV3), or an FV3-like strain isolated from a frog-culturing facility in Georgia, USA (RCV-Z2). We compared single-virus to pairwise co-exposures while experimentally accounting for dosage. Co-exposure to ATV and FV3-like strains resulted in almost twice as many infected individuals compared to single-virus exposures, suggesting an effect of co-exposure on viral infectivity. The viral load in infected individuals exposed to ATV and FV3 was also higher than the single-dose FV3 treatment, suggesting an effect of co-exposure on viral replication. In a follow-up experiment, we examined how the co-occurrence of ATV and FV3 affected epizootics in mesocosm populations of larval western chorus frogs Pseudacris triseriata. Although ATV did not generally establish within host populations (<4% prevalence), when ATV and FV3 were both present, this co-exposure resulted in a larger epizootic of FV3. Our results emphasize the importance of multi-pathogen interactions in epizootic dynamics and have management implications for natural and commercial amphibian populations.","author":[{"family":"Mihaljevic","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Hoverman","given":"Jason T."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Pieter T.

  {"id":"miko2015","abstract":"The heavy application of pesticides and its potential effects on natural communities has attracted increasing attention to inadvertent impacts of these chemicals. Toxicologists conventionally use laboratory-based tests to assess lethal concentrations of pesticides. However, these tests often do not take into account indirect, interactive and long-term effects, and tend to ignore different rates of disintegration in the laboratory and under natural conditions. Our aim was to investigate the importance of the experimental venue for ecotoxicology tests. We reared tadpoles of the agile frog (Rana dalmatina) in the laboratory and in outdoor mesocosms and exposed them to three initial concentrations of a glyphosatebased herbicide (0, 2 and 6.5 mg a.e./l glyphosate), and to the presence or absence of caged predators (dragonﬂy larvae). The type of experimental venue had a large effect on the outcome: The herbicide was less lethal to tadpoles reared in outdoor mesocosms than in the laboratory. Further, while the herbicide had a negative effect on development time and on body mass in the laboratory, tadpoles exposed to the herbicide in mesocosms were larger at metamorphosis and developed faster in comparison to those reared in the absence of the herbicide. The effect of the herbicide on morphological traits of tadpoles also differed between the two venues. Finally, in the presence of the herbicide, tadpoles tended to be more active and to stay closer to the bottom of laboratory containers, while tadpole behaviour shifted in the opposite direction in outdoor mesocosms. Our results demonstrate major discrepancies between results of a classic laboratory-based ecotoxicity test and outcomes of an experiment performed in outdoor mesocosms. Consequently, the use of standard laboratory tests may have to be reconsidered and their beneﬁts carefully weighed against the difﬁculties of performing experiments under more natural conditions. Tests validating experimentally estimated impacts of herbicides under natural conditions and studies identifying key factors determining the applicability of experimental results are urgently needed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Bias in estimators of occupancy, colonization, and extinction can be severe when false positives occur. Accordingly, we propose models that simultaneously account for both types of error. Our approach can be used to improve estimates of occupancy for study designs where a subset of detections is of a type or method for which false positives can be assumed to not occur. We illustrate properties of the estimators with simulations and data for three species of frogs. We show that models that account for possible misidentiﬁcation have greater support (lower AIC for two species) and can yield substantially different occupancy estimates than those that do not.

OPSCR models can also estimate spatial variation in vital rates, but such models are neither widely used nor thoroughly tested. We developed a Bayesian OSPCR model that not only accounts for spatial variation in survival using spatial covariates, but also estimates local density-dependent effects on survival within a unified framework. Using simulations, we show that OPSCR models provide sound inferences on the effect of spatial covariates on survival, including multiple competing sources of mortality, each with potentially different spatial determinants. Estimation of local density-dependent survival was possible but required more data due to the greater complexity of the model. Not accounting for spatial heterogeneity in survival led to positive bias in abundance estimates (up to 10% relative bias). We provide a set of features in R package nimbleSCR that allow computationally efficient fitting of Bayesian OPSCR models with spatially varying survival. The ability to make population-level inferences of spatial variation in survival is an essential step towards a fully spatially-explicit OPSCR model that can disentangle the role of multiple spatial drivers on population dynamics.\n          \n            Open Research statement\n            \n              code to reproduce the analysis is available on github;\n              https://github.com/Cyril-Milleret/Public/tree/master/SpatialSurvivalOPSCR","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Milleret","given":"Cyril"},{"family":"Dey","given":"Soumen"},{"family":"Dupont","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Turek","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Valpine","given":"Perry","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Bischof","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"milleret2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.03.04.482982","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,6]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Ecology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Estimating spatially variable and density-dependent survival using open-population spatial capture-recapture models","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.03.04.482982"},

  {"id":"mimno2015","abstract":"Significance\n            Bayesian models, including admixture models, are a powerful framework for articulating complex assumptions about large-scale genetic data; such models are widely used to explore data or to study population-level statistics of interest. However, we assume that a Bayesian model does not oversimplify the complexities in the data, to the point of invalidating our analyses. Here, we develop and study procedures for quantitatively evaluating admixture models of genetic data. Using four large genetic studies, we demonstrate that model checking should be an important part of the modern genetic data analysis pipeline. Our methods help to support inferences drawn from recovered population structure, to protect scientists from being misled by a misspecified model class, and to point scientists toward useful model extensions.\n          , \n            Admixture models are a ubiquitous approach to capture latent population structure in genetic samples. Despite the widespread application of admixture models, little thought has been devoted to the quality of the model fit or the accuracy of the estimates of parameters of interest for a particular study. Here we develop methods for validating admixture models based on posterior predictive checks (PPCs), a Bayesian method for assessing the quality of fit of a statistical model to a specific dataset. We develop PPCs for five population-level statistics of interest: within-population genetic variation, background linkage disequilibrium, number of ancestral populations, between-population genetic variation, and the downstream use of admixture parameters to correct for population structure in association studies. Using PPCs, we evaluate the quality of the admixture model fit to four qualitatively different population genetic datasets: the population reference sample (POPRES) European individuals, the HapMap phase 3 individuals, continental Indians, and African American individuals. We found that the same model fitted to different genomic studies resulted in highly study-specific results when evaluated using PPCs, illustrating the utility of PPCs for model-based analyses in large genomic studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Mimno","given":"David"},{"family":"Blei","given":"David M."},{"family":"Engelhardt","given":"Barbara E."}],"citation-key":"mimno2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (\n              n\n               = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (\n              P\n               < 0.0001,\n              d\n               = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (\n              P\n               = 0.0116,\n              d\n               = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities.

  {"id":"monnahan2017","abstract":"Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology, and is often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such as the widely used BUGS family (BUGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS). However, some models have prohibitively long run times when implemented in BUGS. A relatively new software platform called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature of HMC. Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models. We then compared the relative efficiency of BUGS and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterization of random effects, known as non-centering. For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterization than BUGS. Stan may also be more robust to biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces diagnostic warnings where BUGS provides none. Disadvantages of Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on tuning. Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for problems where BUGS is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems, leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and population growth rates, meta-analyses and cross-system comparisons and spatiotemporal models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Monnahan","given":"Cole C."},{"family":"Thorson","given":"James T."},{"family":"Branch","given":"Trevor A."}],"citation-key":"monnahan2017","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12681","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"339-348","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Faster estimation of Bayesian models in ecology using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12681","volume":"8"},

This prediction has been tested by looking for a negative correlation between the sensitivities (or elasticities) of the elements in a projection matrix and their variances (or coefﬁcients of variation). Here, we show by constructing random matrices that a spurious negative correlation exists between the sensitivities and variances, and between the elasticities and coefﬁcients of variation, of matrix elements. This spurious correlation arises in part because size transition probabilities, which are bounded by 0 and 1, have a limit to their variability that often does not apply to matrix elements representing reproduction. We advocate an alternative analysis based on the underlying vital rates (not the matrix elements) that accounts for the inherent limit to the variability of zero-to-one vital rates, corrects for sampling variation, and tests for a declining upper limit to variability as a vital rate’s ﬁtness contribution increases. Applying this analysis to demographic data from ﬁve populations of the alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis, we provide evidence of stronger buffering in the vital rates that most inﬂuence ﬁtness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"William F."},{"family":"Doak","given":"Daniel F."}],"citation-key":"morris2004","container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/382550","ISSN":"0003-0147, 1537-5323","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4]]},"language":"en","page":"579-590","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Buffering of life histories against environmental stochasticity: Accounting for a spurious correlation between the variabilities of vital rates and their contributions to fitness","title-short":"Buffering of life histories against environmental stochasticity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/382550","volume":"163"},
  {"id":"morris2021","abstract":"Translocation—moving individuals for release in different locations—is among the most important conservation interventions for increasing or re-establishing populations of threatened species. However, translocations often fail. To improve their effectiveness, we need to understand the features that distinguish successful from failed translocations. We assembled and analysed a global database of translocations of terrestrial vertebrates (n = 514) to assess the effects of various design features and extrinsic factors on success. We analysed outcomes using standardised metrics: a categorical success/failure classification; and population growth rate. Probability of categorical success and population growth rate increased with the total number of individuals released but with diminishing returns above about 20–50 individuals. Positive outcomes—categorical success and high population growth—were less likely for translocations in Oceania, possibly because invasive species are a major threat in this region and are difficult to control at translocation sites. Rates of cate­ gorical success and population growth were higher in Europe and North America than elsewhere, suggesting the key role of context in positive translocation outcomes. Categorical success has increased throughout the 20th century, but that increase may have plateaued at about 75% since about 1990. Our results suggest there is potential for further increase in the success of conservation translocations. This could be best achieved by greater investment in individual projects, as indicated by total number of animals released, which has not in­ creased over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"Shane D."},{"family":"Brook","given":"Barry W."},{"family":"Moseby","given":"Katherine E."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Christopher N."}],"citation-key":"morris2021","container-title":"Global Ecology and Conservation","container-title-short":"Global Ecology and Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01630","ISSN":"23519894","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","page":"e01630","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Factors affecting success of conservation translocations of terrestrial vertebrates: A global systematic review","title-short":"Factors affecting success of conservation translocations of terrestrial vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2351989421001803","volume":"28"},

For each case, we show that which terms or transformations are considered to be lower-order, and therefore marginal, depends on the scale of measurement, which is frequently arbitrary. Understanding the implications of this point leads to an intuitive understanding of the curse of dimensionality.

  {"id":"mosher2018","abstract":"Emerging infectious diseases are an increasingly common threat to wildlife. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is an emerging infectious disease that has been linked to amphibian declines around the world. Few studies exist that explore amphibian–Bd dynamics at the landscape scale, limiting our ability to identify which factors are associated with variation in population susceptibility and to develop effective in situ disease management. Declines of boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) in the southern Rocky Mountains are largely attributed to chytridiomycosis but variation exists in local extinction of boreal toads across this metapopulation. Using a large-scale historic data set, we explored several potential factors influencing disease dynamics in the boreal toad–Bd system: geographic isolation of populations, amphibian community richness, elevational differences, and habitat permanence. We found evidence that boreal toad extinction risk was lowest at high elevations where temperatures may be suboptimal for Bd growth and where small boreal toad populations may be below the threshold needed for efficient pathogen transmission. In addition, boreal toads were more likely to recolonize high elevation sites after local extinction, again suggesting that high elevations may provide refuge from disease for boreal toads. We illustrate a modeling framework that will be useful to natural resource managers striving to make decisions in amphibian–Bd systems.

  {"id":"mosher2018a","abstract":"Understanding the ecosystem-level persistence of pathogens is essential for predicting and measuring host–pathogen dynamics. However, this process is often masked, in part due to a reliance on host-based pathogen detection methods. The amphibian pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal) are pathogens of global conservation concern. Despite having free-living life stages, little is known about the distribution and persistence of these pathogens outside of their amphibian hosts. We combine historic amphibian monitoring data with contemporary host- and environment-based pathogen detection data to obtain estimates of Bd occurrence independent of amphibian host distributions. We also evaluate differences in filter- and swab-based detection probability and assess inferential differences arising from using different decision criteria used to classify samples as positive or negative. Water filtration-based detection probabilities were lower than those from swabs but were > 10%, and swab-based detection probabilities varied seasonally, declining in the early fall. The decision criterion used to classify samples as positive or negative was important; using a more liberal criterion yielded higher estimates of Bd occurrence than when a conservative criterion was used. Different covariates were important when using the liberal or conservative criterion in modeling Bd detection. We found evidence of long-term Bd persistence for several years after an amphibian host species of conservation concern, the boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas), was last detected. Our work provides evidence of long-term Bd persistence in the ecosystem, and underscores the importance of environmental samples for understanding and mitigating disease-related threats to amphibian biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Mosher","given":"Brittany A."},{"family":"Huyvaert","given":"Kathryn P."},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Larissa L."}],"citation-key":"mosher2018a","container-title":"Oecologia","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-018-4167-6","ISSN":"0029-8549, 1432-1939","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"319-330","source":"Crossref","title":"Beyond the swab: ecosystem sampling to understand the persistence of an amphibian pathogen","title-short":"Beyond the swab","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00442-018-4167-6","volume":"188"},

The amphibian-k­ illing fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has a global distribution, unusually broad host range, and high genetic diversity. Phenotypic plasticity may be an important process that allows this pathogen to infect hundreds of species in diverse environments. We quantified phenotypic variation of nine Bd genotypes from two Bd lineages (Global Pandemic Lineage [GPL] and Brazil) and a hybrid (GPL-­Brazil) grown at three temperatures (12, 18 and 24°C). We measured five functional traits including two morphological traits (zoospore and zoosporangium sizes) and three life history traits (carrying capacity, time to fastest growth and exponential growth rate) in a phylogenetic framework. Temperature caused highly plastic responses within each genotype, with all Bd genotypes showing phenotypic plasticity in at least three traits. Among genotypes, Bd generally showed the same direction of plastic response to temperature: larger zoosporangia, higher carrying capacity, longer time to fastest growth and slower exponential growth at lower temperatures. The exception was zoospore size, which was highly variable. Our findings indicate that Bd genotypes have evolved novel phenotypes through plastic responses to temperature over very short timescales. High phenotypic variability likely extends to other traits and may facilitate the large host range and rapid spread of Bd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Muletz-Wolz","given":"Carly R."},{"family":"Barnett","given":"Samuel E."},{"family":"DiRenzo","given":"Graziella V."},{"family":"Zamudio","given":"Kelly R."},{"family":"Toledo","given":"L.

  {"id":"muller2020","abstract":"Across vertebrates, species with intense male mating competition and high levels of sexual dimorphism in body size generally exhibit dimorphism in age-speciﬁc fertility. Compared with females, males show later ages at ﬁrst reproduction and earlier reproductive senescence because they take longer to attain adult body size and musculature, and maintain peak condition for a limited time. This normally yields a shorter male duration of effective breeding, but this reduction might be attenuated in species that frequently use coalitionary aggression. Here, we present comparative genetic and demographic data on chimpanzees from three long-term study communities (Kanyawara: Kibale National Park, Uganda; Mitumba and Kasekela: Gombe National Park, Tanzania), comprising 581 male risk years and 112 infants, to characterize male age-speciﬁc fertility. For comparison, we update estimates from female chimpanzees in the same sites and append a sample of human foragers (the Tanzanian Hadza). Consistent with the idea that aggressive mating competition favors youth, chimpanzee males attained a higher maximum fertility than females, followed by a steeper decline with age. Males did not show a delay in reproduction compared with females, however, as adolescents in both sites successfully reproduced by targeting young, subfecund females, who were less attractive to adults. Gombe males showed earlier reproductive senescence and a shorter duration of effective breeding than Gombe females. By contrast, older males in Kanyawara generally continued to reproduce, apparently by forming coalitions with the alpha. Hadza foragers showed a distinct pattern of sexual dimorphism in age-speciﬁc fertility as, compared with women, men gained conceptions later but continued reproducing longer. In sum, both humans and chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in age-speciﬁc fertility that deviated from predictions drawn from primates with more extreme body size dimorphism, suggesting altered dynamics of male-male competition in the two lineages. In both species, coalitions appear important for extending male reproductive careers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Muller","given":"Martin N."},{"family":"Blurton Jones","given":"Nicholas G."},{"family":"Colchero","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Melissa Emery"},{"family":"Enigk","given":"Drew K."},{"family":"Feldblum","given":"Joseph T."},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Beatrice H."},{"family":"Langergraber","given":"Kevin E."},{"family":"Scully","given":"Erik J."},{"family":"Vigilant","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Kara K."},{"family":"Wrangham","given":"Richard W."},{"family":"Wroblewski","given":"Emily E."},{"family":"Pusey","given":"Anne E."}],"citation-key":"muller2020","container-title":"Journal of Human Evolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Human Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2020.102795","ISSN":"00472484","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"102795","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sexual dimorphism in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and human age-specific fertility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047248420300567","volume":"144"},

Studying the response of organisms to the occurrence of large ﬁres is crucial to anticipate shifts in patterns of biodiversity in ﬁre-prone regions. Amphibia is the most threatened terrestrial vertebrate taxon, although it is also the least studied in relation to its response to ﬁre. We evaluated the resistance to ﬁre (similarity in species composition before and after ﬁre) and reproductive success during the ﬁrst breeding season after a ﬁre of an amphibian community at the Mediterranean basin. We sampled 33 aquatic habitats, including ponds and streams located inside and outside the perimeter of the ﬁre, and reported the presence of adult amphibians and their reproductive success. The community composition in burnt and unburnt areas was compared by similarity analysis. Generalized Linear Models were used to test the eﬀects of ﬁre (burnt or unburnt area), habitat type (stream or pond), distance to the perimeter of the wildﬁre, and altitude on total and breeding species richness. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in amphibian community composition between burnt and unburnt areas, or in total species richness per water point. Of the 12 species found in the study area, only frogs of the genus Hyla declined in the burnt area due to the destruction of their preferred microhabitat, i.e. vegetation surrounding ponds. In contrast, breeding occurrence and breeding species richness declined in burnt streams and ponds. These results suggest a high amphibian resistance to ﬁre at the community level, although the reduction of breeding activity can threaten the persistence of a rich community in future scenarios of increased recurrence of megaﬁres.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Felicísimo","given":"Ángel M."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Xavier"}],"citation-key":"munoz2019","container-title":"Acta Oecologica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actao.2019.06.002","ISSN":"1146609X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"103439","source":"Crossref","title":"Assessing the resistance of a breeding amphibian community to a large wildfire","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1146609X1830451X","volume":"99"},

We evaluated how varying humidity, contact with water, and temperature affected the manifestation of chytridiomycosis in boreal toads Anaxyrus (Bufo) boreas boreas and how prior exposure to Bd affects the likelihood of survival after re-exposure, such as may occur seasonally in long-lived species. Humidity did not affect survival or the degree of Bd infection, but a longer time in contact with water increased the likelihood of mortality. After exposure to ~106 Bd zoospores, all toads in continuous contact with water died within 30 d. Moreover, Bd-exposed toads that were disease-free after 64 d under dry conditions, developed lethal chytridiomycosis within 70 d of transfer to wet conditions. Toads in unheated aquaria (mean = 15°C) survived less than 48 d, while those in moderately heated aquaria (mean = 18°C) survived 115 d post-exposure and exhibited behavioral fever, selecting warmer sites across a temperature gradient. We also found benefits of prior Bd infection: previously exposed toads survived 3 times longer than Bd-naïve toads after re-exposure to 106 zoospores (89 vs. 30 d), but only when dry microenvironments were available. This study illustrates how the outcome of Bd infection in boreal toads is environmentally dependent: when continuously wet, high reinfection rates may overwhelm defenses, but periodic drying, moderate warming, and previous infection may allow infected toads to extend their survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Murphy","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"St-Hilaire","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Corn","given":"Paul S."}],"citation-key":"murphy2011","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao02336","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"31-42","source":"Crossref","title":"Temperature, hydric environment, and prior pathogen exposure alter the experimental severity of chytridiomycosis in boreal toads","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v95/n1/p31-42/","volume":"95"},

We found that endemic chytridiomycosis was associated with a substantial reduction (approximately 38%) in apparent monthly survival of the threatened rainforest treefrog Litoria pearsoniana despite a long period of coexistence (approximately 30 years); detection rate was not influenced by disease status; improved recovery and reduced infection rates correlated with decreased prevalence, which occurred when temperatures increased; and incorporating changes in individuals’ infection status through time with multistate models increased effect size and support (98.6% vs. 71% of total support) for the presence of disease-associated mortality when compared with a Cormack–Jolly–Seber model in which infection status was restricted to the time of first capture. Our results indicate that amphibian populations can face significant ongoing pressure from chytridiomycosis long after epidemics associated with initial Bd invasions subside, an important consideration for the long-term conservation of many amphibian species worldwide.

  {"id":"murray2010","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis is the worst disease to affect vertebrate biodiversity on record. In Australia, it is thought to have caused the extinction of four frog species, and it threatens the survival of at least 10 more. We report the current distribution and host range of this invasive disease in Australia, which is essential knowledge for conservation management. We envisage that the data be used in a global and national context for predictive modeling, meta-analyses, and risk assessment. Our continent-wide data set comprises 821 sites in Australia and includes 10 183 records from .80 contributors spanning collection dates from 1956 to 2007. Sick and dead frogs from the ﬁeld and apparently healthy frogs from museum collections were tested opportunistically for the presence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the fungal pathogen causing chytridiomycosis, and apparently healthy frogs and tadpoles found during surveys were tested purposively. The diagnostic tests used were histology of skin samples and quantitative PCR of skin swabs. Chytridiomycosis was found in all Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory, but not in the Northern Territory. Currently it appears to be conﬁned to the relatively cool and wet areas of Australia, such as along the Great Dividing Range and adjacent coastal areas in the eastern mainland states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, eastern and central Tasmania, southern South Australia, and southwestern Western Australia. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis may have been introduced into Australia via the port of Brisbane around 1978 and spread northward and southward. It did not appear to arrive in Western Australia until 1985. The earliest records from South Australia and Tasmania are from 1995 and 2004, respectively, although archival studies from these states are lacking. We also report negative ﬁndings showing that the disease does not currently occur in some areas that appear to be environmentally suitable, including Cape York Peninsula in Queensland and most of the World Heritage Area in western Tasmania. Infection with B. dendrobatidis has been recorded from 63 frog species in Australia to date, all belonging to the Hylidae, Limnodynastidae, and Myobatrachidae, with the exception of one individual of a species from the Microhylidae and the introduced cane toad of the family Bufonidae.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Kris A."},{"family":"Retallick","given":"Richard"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Mendez","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Aplin","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Kirkpatrick","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David"},{"family":"Hines","given":"Harry B."},{"family":"Campbell","given":"R."},{"family":"Pauza","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Driessen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Speare","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Freeman","given":"Alastair"},{"family":"Phillott","given":"Andrea D."},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"},{"family":"Kriger","given":"Kerry"},{"family":"Driscoll","given":"Don"},{"family":"Felton","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Puschendorf","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."}],"citation-key":"murray2010","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/09-1608.1","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5]]},"language":"en","page":"1557-1558","source":"Crossref","title":"The distribution and host range of the pandemic disease chytridiomycosis in Australia, spanning surveys from 1956–2007","title-short":"The distribution and host range of the pandemic disease chytridiomycosis in Australia, spanning surveys from 1956–2007","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/09-1608.1","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"murray2013","abstract":"The pandemic amphibian disease chytridiomycosis often exhibits strong seasonality in both prevalence and diseaseassociated mortality once it becomes endemic. One hypothesis that could explain this temporal pattern is that simple weather-driven pathogen proliferation (population growth) is a major driver of chytridiomycosis disease dynamics. Despite various elaborations of this hypothesis in the literature for explaining amphibian declines (e.g., the chytrid thermal-optimum hypothesis) it has not been formally tested on infection patterns in the wild. In this study we developed a simple processbased model to simulate the growth of the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) under varying weather conditions to provide an a priori test of a weather-linked pathogen proliferation hypothesis for endemic chytridiomycosis. We found strong support for several predictions of the proliferation hypothesis when applied to our model species, Litoria pearsoniana, sampled across multiple sites and years: the weather-driven simulations of pathogen growth potential (represented as a growth index in the 30 days prior to sampling; GI30) were positively related to both the prevalence and intensity of Bd infections, which were themselves strongly and positively correlated. In addition, a machine-learning classifier achieved ,72% success in classifying positive qPCR results when utilising just three informative predictors 1) GI30, 2) frog body size and 3) rain on the day of sampling. Hence, while intrinsic traits of the individuals sampled (species, size, sex) and nuisance sampling variables (rainfall when sampling) influenced infection patterns obtained when sampling via qPCR, our results also strongly suggest that weather-linked pathogen proliferation plays a key role in the infection dynamics of endemic chytridiomycosis in our study system. Predictive applications of the model include surveillance design, outbreak preparedness and response, climate change scenario modelling and the interpretation of historical patterns of amphibian decline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Kris A."},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Garland","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Kriticos","given":"Darren"},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish"}],"citation-key":"murray2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0061061","editor":[{"family":"Canestrelli","given":"Daniele"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,17]]},"language":"en","page":"e61061","source":"Crossref","title":"Whether the weather drives patterns of endemic amphibian chytridiomycosis: a pathogen proliferation approach","title-short":"Whether the weather drives patterns of endemic amphibian chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0061061","volume":"8"},

We used capture–recapture data and a multistate model where state was treated as a hidden Markov process to incorporate disease state uncertainty and assess our a priori hypotheses. Our results indicated that snowpack during the coldest week of winter is more influential to toad survival, disease transition probabilities, and the population-level prevalence of the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) in the spring, than temperatures in the fall or the presence of another host. As hypothesized, apparent survival at low (i.e., ,25 cm) snowpack (0.22; confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.15–0.31) was lower than apparent survival at high snowpack (90.65; CI ¼ 0.50–0.78). Our findings highlight the potential for local environmental factors, like snowpack, to influence disease and host persistence, and demonstrate the ecological complexity of disease effects on population demography in natural environments.

In ﬂammable ecosystems, there is great potential to use ﬁre for animal conservation, however most ﬁre-based conservation strategies do not explicitly consider interacting factors. In this study, we sought to understand the interrelationships between the endangered heath mouse Pseudomys shortridgei, ﬁre, resource availability and the introduced fox Vulpes vulpes in southeast Australia. We predicted that heath-mouse relative abundance would respond indirectly to post-ﬁre age class (recently burnt; 0–3 years since ﬁre, early; 4–9 years, mid; 10–33 years and late; 34–79 years) via the mediating effects of resources (shrub cover and plant-group diversity) and fox relative abundance. We used structural equation modelling to determine the strength of hypothesized pathways between variables, and mediation analysis to detect indirect effects. Both the cover of shrubs (0–50 cm from the ground) and fox relative abundance were associated with post-ﬁre age class. Shrub cover was highest 0–9 years after ﬁre, while fox relative abundance was highest in recently burnt vegetation (0–3 years after ﬁre). Heath mice were positively correlated with shrub cover and plant-group diversity, and negatively correlated with fox relative abundance. We did not detect a direct relationship between heath mice and post-ﬁre age class, but they were indirectly associated with age class via its inﬂuence on both shrub cover and fox relative abundance. Our ﬁndings suggest that heath mice will beneﬁt from a ﬁre regime promoting dense shrub regeneration in combination with predator control.

  {"id":"narayan2014","abstract":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a cutaneous amphibian fungus that causes the lethal disease chytridiomycosis, has been implicated as a cause of many amphibian declines. Bd can tolerate low temperatures with an optimum thermal range from 17–24°C. It has been shown that Bd infection may result in species extinction, avoiding the transmission threshold presented by density dependent transmission theory. Prevalence of Bd during autumn and winter has been shown to be as low as 0% in some species. It is currently unclear how Bd persists in field conditions and what processes result in carry-over between seasons. It has been hypothesised that overwintering tadpoles may host Bd between breeding seasons. The Great Barred Frog (Mixophyes fasciolatus) is a common, stable and widespread species in Queensland, Australia, and is known to carry Bd. Investigation into Bd infection of different life stages of M. fasciolatus during seasonally low prevalence may potentially reveal persistence and carry-over methods between seasons. Metamorphs, juveniles, and adults were swabbed for Bd infection over three months (between March and May, 2011) at 5 sites of varying altitude (66 m–790 m). A total of 93 swabs were analysed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) real-time analysis. PCR analysis showed 6 positive (1 excluded), 4 equivocal and 83 negative results for infection with Bd. Equivocal results were assumed to be negative using the precautionary principle. The 5 positive results consisted of 4 emerging (Gosner stage 43–45) metamorphs and 1 adult M. fasciolatus. Fisher's exact test on prevalence showed that the prevalence was significantly different between life stages. All positive results were sampled at high altitudes (790 m); however prevalence was not significantly different between altitudes. Infection of emerging metamorphs suggests that individuals were infected as tadpoles. We hypothesise that M. fasciolatus tadpoles carry Bd through seasons. Thus, Mixophyes fasciolatus may act as disease reservoirs at multiple life stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Narayan","given":"Edward J."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Clara"},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish"},{"family":"Hero","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"narayan2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0092499","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,19]]},"page":"e92499","PMCID":"PMC3960252","PMID":"24647532","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Over-wintering tadpoles of <i>Mixophyes fasciolatus</i> act as reservoir host for <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960252/","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"neely2020","abstract":"Cool-adapted species inhabiting montane tropical forests are vulnerable to heat stress associated with climate warming. According to the thermal mismatch hypothesis, pathogens are predicted to have broader thermal tolerances than their hosts, which can lead to increased pathogen loads and host mortality when temperatures are outside hosts' thermal optima. We tested the thermal mismatch hypothesis in two habitat generalist species expected to have wide thermal tolerance ranges: Dendropsophus minutus captured at a high elevation and D. elegans captured at a warmer low elevation. We also tested high-elevation individuals of the Brazilian directdeveloping species Ischnocnema parva, which are expected to have a narrow thermal tolerance range based on life history. We exposed all frogs to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) under three temperatures ranging from the average nighttime temperature where frogs were collected (16 and 21 °C for high and low elevations, respectively) to a simulated warming event (26 °C). Bd loads across all three host species were negatively associated with temperature. However, the interaction between Bd infection and warming led to increased mortality in cool-adapted I. parva at higher temperatures, despite lower infection loads. Our results indicate that Bd may lead to declines of cool-adapted montane frogs under the combined pressures of pathogen infection and warming, even at temperatures approaching the pathogen's upper thermal limit. Thus, climatic warming at a level that lowers ﬁtness of heat-sensitive pathogens may not uniformly reduce host disease risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Neely","given":"Wesley J."},{"family":"Greenspan","given":"Sasha E."},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Luisa P."},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Tamilie"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Renato A."},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"David"},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."},{"family":"Haddad","given":"Célio F.B."},{"family":"Toledo","given":"Luís Felipe"},{"family":"Becker","given":"C.

  {"id":"newell2013","abstract":"Amphibians have undergone dramatic declines and extinctions worldwide. Prominent among these have been the streambreeding frogs in the rainforests of eastern Australia. The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been postulated as the primary cause of these declines. We conducted a capture-mark-recapture study over a 7-year period on the endangered Fleay’s barred frog (Mixophyes fleayi) at two independent streams (30 km apart) in order to assess the stability of these populations. This species had undergone a severe decline across its narrow geographic range. Markrecapture modelling showed that the number of individuals increased 3–10 fold along stream transects over this period. Frog detection probabilities were frequently above 50% but declined as the populations increased. Adult survival was important to overall population persistence in light of low recruitment events, suggesting that longevity may be a key factor in this recovery. One male and female were present in the capture record for .6 years.

  {"id":"nordberg2017","abstract":"At high latitudes and elevations, snakes spend considerable time in overwintering refugia. Although brumation is generally associated with periods of inactivity, some evidence supports the occurrence of limited above and below ground activity during winter. Observations of such events are rare due to the inaccessibility of the typical subterranean refugia of snakes. Our study examined occurrences of both surface and subterranean activity during winter in the Timber Rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus. We monitored hourly body temperatures (Tbs) and small-scale above and below ground movement bouts throughout the overwintering period in Tennessee, USA. High frequency monitoring of body temperatures and movement patterns allowed us to identify mid-winter activity as well as shuttling behavior during ingress and egress. We recorded environmental temperatures and snake operative temperatures to estimate periods when snakes were surface active. Snake ingress into brumation occurred on 10 October ± 12 d, and egress occurred on 7 April ± 17 d. We recorded 53,041 Tbs (mean snake Tb = 11.0 ± 3.6° C; range 1.1–33.7° C) collected over two overwintering periods (2011–2012 and 2012–2013). Snakes made on average 6.1 ± 1.2 movement bouts throughout winter, accumulating a total distance of 146.4 ± 35.5 m. All individuals made small (< 10 m) movements throughout winter. We speculate that milder winters and the increased prevalence of suitable surface temperatures will promote additional winter activity.","author":[{"family":"Nordberg","given":"Eric J"},{"family":"Cobb","given":"Vincent A"}],"citation-key":"nordberg2017","container-title":"Herpetological Conservation and Biology","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"606-615","source":"Zotero","title":"Body temperatures and winter activity in overwintering timber rattlesnakes (<i>Crotalus horridus</i>) in Tennessee, USA","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

We randomly assigned groups of larvae to 0.22-m3 mesh ﬁeld enclosures in each pond (n = 2–3 enclosures per pond) and measured environmental variables that might contribute to observed amphibian responses including pH, temperature, and periphyton growth. After 15 d, when larvae began metamorphosing, mean survival was signiﬁcantly higher in the most-recently burned ponds. The TSF did not have a signiﬁcant effect on developmental stage or tadpole size, although Oak Toad larvae tended to develop faster in the most-recently burned ponds. Although all ponds were acidic (pH < 4.3), there was a trend toward higher pH in the more-recently burned ponds, and survival was signiﬁcantly positively correlated with pH.

We test this prediction using both local-scale data from Costa Rica and global analyses of over 11 000 Bd infection assays. We ﬁnd that infection prevalence decreases with increasing thermal tolerance mismatch and with increasing host tolerance of habitat modiﬁcation. The relationship between environmental tolerance mismatches and Bd infection prevalence is generalisable across multiple amphibian families and spatial scales, and the magnitude of the tolerance mismatch effect depends on environmental context.

  {"id":"odonnell2015","abstract":"Prescribed ﬁre and timber harvest are anthropogenic disturbances that modify resource availability and ecosystem structure, and can affect wildlife both directly and indirectly. Terrestrial salamanders are effective indicators of forest health due to their high abundance and sensitivity to microclimatic conditions. Given their ecological importance, it is critical to understand how forest salamanders respond to management-related disturbances. We predicted that timber harvest and prescribed ﬁre would decrease salamander abundance and availability, and increase salamander cover object use. We surveyed for southern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon serratus) over 9 sampling periods from 2010 to 2014 in a Missouri Ozark (USA) forest, and used binomial mixture models to estimate abundance and detectability in a large-scale Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) experiment. Five replicate 5-ha units were randomly assigned to each treatment (prescribed burn, shelterwood harvest, midstory herbicide) and control. We compared abundance, surface activity, detectability, and microhabitat use among treatments. Abundance and surface activity decreased post-treatment in shelterwood, midstory, and burn units. Abundance estimates in midstory and burn units rebounded in the second post-treatment year but declined further in shelterwood harvest units. Overall, treatments had stronger effects on salamander availability than on actual abundance. We also found a higher proportion of salamanders under cover objects after prescribed ﬁre, further illustrating the importance of accounting for imperfect detectability. Our ﬁndings foster a more robust understanding of the mechanisms underlying population-level responses to management practices, ultimately increasing our ability to manage terrestrial salamanders effectively.

  {"id":"odonnell2016","abstract":"Prescribed ﬁre has become a commonly used forest management tool for reducing the occurrence of severe wildﬁres, decreasing fuel loads and reestablishing the historic ecological inﬂuences of ﬁre. Investigating population-level wildlife responses to prescribed ﬁre is important for evaluating the effects of ﬁre management on animals, but in order to predict and simulate wildlife responses to potential management actions, mechanistic studies that elucidate individual-level responses are also necessary. We used radio-frequency identiﬁcation to investigate individual-level responses of western slimy salamanders Plethodon albagula to prescribed ﬁre. We compared the salamander home-range sizes [minimum convex polygons (MCP)], movement behaviors, and activity levels before and after prescribed ﬁre using a randomized block experiment. We initiated the study at three plots in 2011, and added two new plots in 2012. We captured, tagged and released ≥38 salamanders at each plot from May 2011–May 2012 (total N = 205). We recorded 918 total recaptures of 142 unique salamanders; 31% of tagged salamanders were never recaptured. Across all years and treatments, only 14% of relocations were surfaceactive (i.e. visually conﬁrmed) salamanders; the others were underground. Following prescribed ﬁre, the surface-active proportion of recaptures was nearly seven times greater in control versus burned areas, which indicates that P. albagula respond to post-prescribed ﬁre conditions by spending more time belowground. We did not ﬁnd evidence of direct mortality of salamanders from ﬁres; the proportion of known-alive individuals did not differ between treatments. Maximum daily displacement was 43.3% higher among burn-area than control-area salamanders, and MCP varied in a similar pattern; this may indicate salamanders were attempting to ﬁnd more hospitable microenvironments or other resources, such as prey. Together, these individual-level observations corroborate our ﬁndings from a population-level study of a congeneric terrestrial salamander and contribute to our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms underlying population dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Donnell","given":"Katherine M."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Frank R."},{"family":"Semlitsch","given":"Raymond D."}],"citation-key":"odonnell2016","container-title":"Journal of Zoology","DOI":"10.1111/jzo.12316","ISSN":"09528369","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4]]},"language":"en","page":"303-309","source":"Crossref","title":"Prescribed fire alters surface activity and movement behavior of a terrestrial salamander","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/jzo.12316","volume":"298"},

  {"id":"olson2013","abstract":"The rapid worldwide emergence of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is having a profound negative impact on biodiversity. However, global research efforts are fragmented and an overarching synthesis of global infection data is lacking. Here, we provide results from a community tool for the compilation of worldwide Bd presence and report on the analyses of data collated over a four-year period. Using this online database, we analysed: 1) spatial and taxonomic patterns of infection, including amphibian families that appear over- and under-infected; 2) relationships between Bd occurrence and declining amphibian species, including associations among Bd occurrence, species richness, and enigmatic population declines; and 3) patterns of environmental correlates with Bd, including climate metrics for all species combined and three families (Hylidae, Bufonidae, Ranidae) separately, at both a global scale and regional (U.S.A.) scale. These associations provide new insights for downscaled hypothesis testing. The pathogen has been detected in 52 of 82 countries in which sampling was reported, and it has been detected in 516 of 1240 (42%) amphibian species. We show that detected Bd infections are related to amphibian biodiversity and locations experiencing rapid enigmatic declines, supporting the hypothesis that greater complexity of amphibian communities increases the likelihood of emergence of infection and transmission of Bd. Using a global model including all sampled species, the odds of Bd detection decreased with increasing temperature range at a site. Further consideration of temperature range, rather than maximum or minimum temperatures, may provide new insights into Bd-host ecology. Whereas caution is necessary when interpreting such a broad global dataset, the use of our pathogen database is helping to inform studies of the epidemiology of Bd, as well as enabling regional, national, and international prioritization of conservation efforts. We provide recommendations for adaptive management to enhance the database utility and relevance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Deanna H."},{"family":"Aanensen","given":"David M."},{"family":"Ronnenberg","given":"Kathryn L."},{"family":"Powell","given":"Christopher I."},{"family":"Walker","given":"Susan F."},{"family":"Bielby","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Garner","given":"Trenton W.

  {"id":"ortiz-santaliestra2013","abstract":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the fungus responsible for chytridiomycosis, grows on the keratinized parts of the body (i.e., the entire skin of juveniles and adults, and the oral disk of tadpoles).The fungus affects epidermal structures, generating an imbalance of the osmotic equilibrium through the skin that ultimately leads to death. Therefore, larvae are likely to be much more resistant compared with juveniles and adults, which may suffer high mortality. However, nothing is known about how susceptibility varies during the juvenile life stages (from the end of metamorphosis to sexual maturity). The coexistence of tolerant hosts (either tolerant species or unaffected developmental stages) with susceptible hosts is a major reason why chytridiomycosis has become an epidemic disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the interspeciﬁc and developmental variation in susceptibility to Bd in juveniles of three North American anurans. Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens) incurred no lethal effects at 104 Bd zoospores ml-1, regardless of the age at which they were exposed to the fungus. On the contrary, Bd infection was more severe for newly metamorphosed juveniles of American toads (Anaxyrus americanus) than for 4-week-old juveniles. When exposed to 104 Bd zoospores ml-1, newly metamorphosed juveniles of this species experienced mortality rates above 70%, whereas 4-week-old juveniles had mortality rates below 30%. Variations in structural characteristics of the skin or the antifungal efﬁciency of skin peptides are proposed as potential reasons to explain the observed developmental differences in susceptibility to Bd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortiz-Santaliestra","given":"Manuel E."},{"family":"Rittenhouse","given":"Tracy A.

However, their interpretation can be difficult because their distribution is not uniform under the hypothesis that the model did generate the data. To address this issue, procedures to obtain calibrated ppps (cppps) have been proposed although not used in practice, because they require repeated simulation of new data and model estimation via MCMC. Here we give methods to balance the computational trade-off between the number of calibration replicates and the number of MCMC samples per replicate. Our results suggest that investing in a large number of calibration replicates while using short MCMC chains can save significant computation time compared to naive implementations, without significant loss in accuracy. We propose different estimators for the variance of the cppp that can be used to confirm quickly when the model fits the data well. Variance estimation requires the effective sample sizes of many short MCMC chains; we show that these can be well approximated using the single long MCMC chain from the real-data model. The procedure for cppp is implemented in NIMBLE, a flexible framework for hierarchical modeling that supports many models and discrepancy measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Paganin","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Valpine","given":"Perry","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"paganin2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,7]]},"number":"arXiv:2306.04866","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Computational methods for fast Bayesian model assessment via calibrated posterior p-values","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04866"},
  {"id":"palacio2022","abstract":"The widespread use of species traits in basic and applied ecology, conservation and biogeography has led to an exponential increase in functional diversity analyses, with > 10 000 papers published in 2010–2020, and > 1800 papers only in 2021. This interest is reflected in the development of a multitude of theoretical and methodological frameworks for calculating functional diversity, making it challenging to navigate the myriads of options and to report detailed accounts of trait-based analyses. Therefore, the discipline of trait-based ecology would benefit from the existence of a general guideline for standard reporting and good practices for analyses. We devise an eight-step protocol to guide researchers in conducting and reporting functional diversity analyses, with the overarching goal of increasing reproducibility, transparency and comparability across studies. The protocol is based on: 1) identification of a research question; 2) a sampling scheme and a study design; 3–4) assemblage of data matrices; 5) data exploration and preprocessing; 6) functional diversity computation; 7) model fitting, evaluation and interpretation; and 8) data, metadata and code provision. Throughout the protocol, we provide information on how to best select research questions, study designs, trait data, compute functional diversity, interpret results and discuss ways to ensure reproducibility in reporting results. To facilitate the implementation of this template, we further develop an interactive web-based application (stepFD) in the form of a checklist workflow, detailing all the steps of the protocol and allowing the user to produce a final ‘reproducibility report' to upload alongside the published paper. A thorough and transparent reporting of functional diversity analyses ensures that ecologists can incorporate others' findings into meta-analyses, the shared data can be integrated into larger databases for consensus analyses, and available code can be reused by other researchers. All these elements are key to pushing forward this vibrant and fast-growing field of research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Palacio","given":"Facundo X."},{"family":"Callaghan","given":"Corey T."},{"family":"Cardoso","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Hudgins","given":"Emma J."},{"family":"Jarzyna","given":"Marta A."},{"family":"Ottaviani","given":"Gianluigi"},{"family":"Riva","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Graco-Roza","given":"Caio"},{"family":"Shirey","given":"Vaughn"},{"family":"Mammola","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"palacio2022","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.06287","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"e06287","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A protocol for reproducible functional diversity analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.06287","volume":"2022"},

However, the impact of this devastating infectious disease can be difficult to gauge without empirical data on the population-level effects of Bd. Often, assessments of the amphibian chytridiomycosis panzootic are based primarily on expert opinions; as a result, declines in tropical areas are promptly attributed to Bd while its impact on temperate species not suffering from adult mass mortalities is frequently overlooked. Here, we investigated the survival probability in an amphibian species from a temperate area that until now has not been considered to be severely impacted by the disease. Specifically, we related individual survival to Bd infection status using long-term capture-mark-recapture data of male spiny common toads (Bufo spinosus) in Sierra de Guadarrama National Park in central Spain. Even though the study population has demonstrated potential for adaptation to Bd and die-offs of adult individuals have not been recorded, our results clearly indicated that the probability of survival was lower for Bd-positive individuals. Moreover, the probability of becoming Bd-positive was higher than the probability of clearance, driving the population to a slow but certain decline. These results are consistent with other indicators of a negative population trend and suggest that the impact of Bd on temperate species of less concern may be greater than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Palomar","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Fernández-Chacón","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Jaime"}],"citation-key":"palomar2022","container-title":"Biodiversity and Conservation","container-title-short":"Biodivers Conserv","DOI":"10.1007/s10531-022-02525-3","ISSN":"0960-3115, 1572-9710","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,3]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Amphibian survival compromised by long-term effects of chytrid fungus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10531-022-02525-3"},

Although PMB is an intuitively appealing concept, it has received little critical analysis. Thus we examined ecosystems where PMB has received the most attention and has been the most extensively implemented: tropical and subtropical savannas of Australia and Africa. We identified serious shortcomings of PMB: the ecological significance of different burning patterns remains unknown and details of desired fire mosaics remain unspecified. This has led to fire-management plans based on pyrodiversity rhetoric that lacks substance in terms of operational guidelines and capacity for meaningful evaluation. We also suggest that not all fire patterns are ecologically meaningful: this seems particularly true for the highly fire-prone savannas of Australia and South Africa.

  {"id":"parsons2022","abstract":"Small mammals are important to the functioning of ecological communities with changes to their abundances used to track impacts of environmental change. While capture–recapture estimates of absolute abundance are preferred, indices of abundance continue to be used in cases of limited sampling, rare species with little data, or unmarked individuals. Improvement to indices can be achieved by calibrating them to absolute abundance but their reliability across years, sites, or species is unclear. To evaluate this, we used the US National Ecological Observatory Network capture–recapture data for 63 small mammal species over 46 sites from 2013 to 2019. We generated 17,155 absolute abundance estimates using capture–recapture analyses and compared these to two standard abundance indices, and three types of calibrated indices. We found that neither raw abundance indices nor index calibrations were reliable approximations of absolute abundance, with raw indices less correlated with absolute abundance than index calibrations (raw indices overall R2 < 0.5, index calibration overall R2 > 0.6). Performance of indices and index calibrations varied by species, with those having higher and less variable capture probabilities performing best. We conclude that indices and index calibration methods should be used with caution with a count of individuals being the best index to use, especially if it can be calibrated with capture probability. None of the indices we tested should be used for comparing different species due to high variation in capture probabilities.

  {"id":"pattinson2020","abstract":"Quantifying organismal sensitivity to heat stress provides one means for predicting vulnerability to climate change. Birds are ideal for investigating this approach, as they display quantifiable fitness consequences associated with behavioural and physiological responses to heat stress. We used a recently developed method that examines correlations between readily-observable behaviours and air temperature (Tair) to investigate interspecific variation in avian responses to heat stress in seasonally hot, arid regions on three continents: the southwestern United States, the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa and the Gascoyne region of western Australia. We found substantial interspecific variation in heat dissipation behaviours (wing-drooping, panting, activity-reduction, shade-seeking) across all three regions. However, pooling the data revealed that little of this interspecific variation was systematically explained by organismal traits (foraging guild, diet, drinking dependency, body mass or activity levels) at the scale we tested. After accounting for phylogeny, we found that larger birds engaged in wingdrooping behaviour at lower Tair and had lower activity levels at high Tair compared to smaller birds, indicating an effect of body mass on heat dissipation behaviour (HDB). In the Kalahari, reliance on drinking was correlated with significantly lower Tair at which panting commenced, suggesting a key role of water acquisition in HDB in that region. Birds also tended to retreat to shade at relatively lower Tair when more active, suggesting a behavioural trade-off between activity, heat load and microsite selection. Our results imply that the causes underlying interspecific variation in heat dissipation behaviours are complex. While the variation we observed was not systematically explained by the broad scale organismal traits we considered, we predict that the indices themselves will still reflect vulnerability to potential fitness costs of high air temperatures. Further research is needed on a species-specific basis to establish the functional significance of these indices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pattinson","given":"Nicholas B."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Michelle L."},{"family":"Griego","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Grace"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Nicola J."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Rowan O."},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Blair O."},{"family":"Smit","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Cunningham","given":"Susan J."},{"family":"McKechnie","given":"Andrew E."},{"family":"Hockey","given":"Philip A.

  {"id":"pavlek2021","abstract":"Aim To disentangle the role of evolutionary history, competition and environmental filtering in driving the niche evolution of four closely related subterranean spiders, with the overarching goal of obtaining a mechanistic description of the factors that determine species' realized distribution in simplified ecological settings. Location Dinaric karst, Balkans, Europe. Taxon Dysderidae spiders (Stalita taenaria, S. pretneri, S. hadzii and Parastalita stygia). Methods We resolved phylogenetic relationships among species and modelled each species' distribution using a set of climatic and habitat variables. We explored the climatic niche differentiation among species with n-dimensional hypervolumes and shifts in their trophic niche using morphological traits related to feeding specialization. Results Climate was the primary abiotic factor explaining our species' distributions, while karstic and soil features were less important. Generally, there was a high niche overlap among species, reflecting their phylogenetic relatedness, but on a finer scale, niche shifts explained the realized distribution patterns. Trophic interaction was another important factor influencing species distributions – the non-overlapping distributions of three morphologically indistinguishable Stalita species is seemingly the outcome of competitive exclusion dynamics. The distribution of the fourth species, Parastalita stygia, overlaps with that of the other species, with several instances of coexistence within caves. As inferred from the morphology of the mouthparts, the mechanism that minimizes interspecific competition is the shift in the trophic niche of P. stygia towards a more specialized diet. Main conclusions We showed that similarity in niches only partly correlated with the phylogenetic distance among species, and that overlaps in species distributions are possible only when a parallel shift in diet occurs. Our work emphasized how even simplified environments still maintain the potential for diversification via niche differentiation. Ultimately, we provide an ecological explanation for the diversification of life in an important hotspot of subterranean diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pavlek","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Mammola","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"pavlek2021","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/jbi.13987","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"118-133","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Niche-based processes explaining the distributions of closely related subterranean spiders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13987","volume":"48"},

Over most of the year pythons exhibited relatively smooth unimodal diel curves of heating and cooling, attaining maximal temperatures around 30°C. The (small) male snakes heated and cooled more rapidly than did the (larger) females. Climatic differences between our two study sites generated substantial shifts in mean body temperatures and thus, in the diel timing of ambush foraging behaviour. Females wrapped tightly around their eggs after oviposition and brooded them throughout the ensuing 8-week incubation period. Throughout this time, females were facultatively endothermic, maintaining high constant temperatures through shivering thermogenesis. Females nesting in sites with relatively poor thermal buffering (under rootballs of fallen trees rather than rock crevices) supplemented endogenous heat production with occasional basking, and hence overall maintained lower and more variable incubation temperatures than did females with “better” nest sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearson","given":"David"},{"family":"Shine","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"pearson2003","container-title":"Journal of Thermal Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Thermal Biology","DOI":"10.1016/S0306-4565(02)00048-7","ISSN":"0306-4565","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",2,1]]},"page":"117-131","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Thermal biology of large snakes in cool climates: a radio-telemetric study of carpet pythons (<i>Morelia spilota imbricata</i>) in south-western Australia","title-short":"Thermal biology of large snakes in cool climates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306456502000487","volume":"28"},

Various non-destructive methods based on body mass and a measure of body length have been used as condition indices (CIs), but the dominant method amongst ecologists is currently the calculation of residuals from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of body mass against length. Recent studies of energy reserves in small mammals and starlings claimed to validate this method, although we argue that they did not include the most appropriate tests since they compared the CI with the absolute size of energy reserves. We present a novel CI (the ‘scaled mass index’) based on the central principle of scaling, with important methodological, biological and conceptual advantages. Through a reanalysis of data from small mammals, starlings and snakes, we show that the scaled mass index is a better indicator of the relative size of energy reserves and other body components than OLS residuals, performing better in all seven species and in 19 out of 20 analyses. We also present an empirical and theoretical comparison of the scaled mass index and OLS residuals as CIs.

Here, we discuss the use of the CV to compare measures of evolvability and phenotypic plasticity, two variational properties of quantitative traits. Using a dimensional analysis, we show that contrary to evolvability, phenotypic plasticity cannot be meaningfully compared across traits and environments by mean-scaling trait variation.

Here we couple a habitat suitability model with a population viability model to examine the interactive effects of climate change and altered ﬁre regimes on a ﬁre-responsive frog species across its geographic range in south-eastern Australia. By 2100, we predict expected minimum abundances (EMA) to decline by 66% (under GFDL-CM2 A1FI climate projections) or 87% (CSIRO Mk3.5 A1FI) in the absence of ﬁre. Increased frequency of low-intensity ﬁres reduced EMA by less than 5%, whereas increased frequency of high-intensity ﬁres reduced EMA by up to 40% compared with the no-ﬁre scenario. While shifts in ﬁre regimes are predicted to impact metapopulation viability, these indirect effects of ﬁre are far less severe than the direct impact of climate change on habitat suitability.

  {"id":"perry2012","abstract":"Fire is being used increasingly as a forest management tool throughout North America, but its effects on reptiles and amphibians in many ecosystems are unclear. Open woodlands with understories dominated by herbaceous vegetation beneﬁt many wildlife species, but maintaining these woodlands requires frequent burning. Although many studies have compared herpetofaunal responses in burned forests to unburned forests, fewer studies have examined changes in the herpetofaunal community during the interval between short-rotation prescribed burns. We examined changes in habitat and relative abundance of reptiles and amphibians each year within a 3-year burn cycle in nine restored pine woodlands of western Arkansas, USA. Overall numbers of reptiles did not change among the three burn years; however, capture rates for one snake species (southern black racer [Coluber constrictor priapus]) and three lizards differed among the three post-burn years. Overall capture rate for anurans and all amphibians combined was greatest the ﬁrst year after burning, mostly because captures of dwarf American toads (Bufo americanus charlessmithi) were substantially greater in stands the ﬁrst year after burning. Salamander captures were infrequent. Capture rates of most reptile and amphibian species declined over the 3-year sampling period.

  {"id":"petracca2024a","abstract":"Recolonizing species exhibit unique population dynamics, namely dispersal to and colonization of new areas, that have important implications for management. A resulting challenge is how to simultaneously model de­ mographic and movement processes so that recolonizing species can be accurately projected over time and space. We introduce a framework for spatially explicit projection modeling that harnesses the rigorous parameter estimation made possible by an integrated population model (IPM) and the flexible movement modeling made possible by an individual-based model (IBM). Our framework has two components: [1] a Bayesian IPM-driven age- and state-structured population model that governs the population state process and estimation of de­ mographic rates, and [2] an IBM-driven spatial model that allows for the projection of dispersal and habitat colonization. We applied this model framework to estimate current and project future dynamics of gray wolves (Canis lupus) in Washington State, USA. We used data from 74 telemetered wolves and yearly pup and pack counts to parameterize the model, and then projected statewide dynamics over 50 years. Mean population growth was 1.29 (95 % Bayesian Credible Interval = 1.26–1.33) during initial recolonization from 2009 to 2020 and decreased to 1.02 (95 % Prediction Interval = 0.98–1.04) in the projection period (2021–2070). Our results suggest that gray wolves have an ~100 % probability of colonizing the last of Washington State's three specified recovery regions by 2030, regardless of alternative assumptions about how dispersing wolves select new terri­ tories. Our spatially explicit projection model can be used to project the dynamics of any species for which spatial spread is an important driver of population dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Petracca","given":"L.S."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"B."},{"family":"Maletzke","given":"B.T."},{"family":"Converse","given":"S.J."}],"citation-key":"petracca2024a","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110340","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"110340","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Merging integrated population models and individual-based models to project population dynamics of recolonizing species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000632072300441X","volume":"289"},
  {"id":"petranka1998","abstract":"Predators can have signi®cant nonlethal effects on prey by modifying prey behaviour through chemically mediated interactions. We examined behavioural responses of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles to both direct and indirect chemical signals associated with a predatory odonate (Anax junius). In laboratory trials, tadpoles of both species responded strongly to water conditioned with Anax nymphs by decreasing foraging rates, becoming immobile, and moving away from the stimulus. The responses to water conditioned with starved Anax versus Anax that fed on conspeci®c tadpoles did not dier signi®cantly; these results suggest that tadpoles rely primarily on direct signals to detect odonates. Rana did not respond to water conditioned with conspeci®c tissue extracts, while Bufo responded with behaviours that were indistinguishable from those of tadpoles exposed to Anax chemicals. In a ®eld experiment, the responses of R. sylvatica tadpoles to Anax chemicals were similar to those of tadpoles observed in the laboratory. Collectively, our data indicate that tadpoles of both species use chemical cues to assess predation risk from other community members. Tadpoles can selectively distinguish members who pose a threat, and only evacuate food patches or reduce foraging rates when in danger. These behaviours appear to be adaptive and are consistent with the predictions of optimality theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Petranka","given":"James"},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"petranka1998","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","DOI":"10.1007/s002650050438","ISSN":"0340-5443, 1432-0762","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",4,24]]},"language":"en","page":"263-271","source":"Crossref","title":"Chemically mediated avoidance of a predatory odonate (<i>Anax junius</i>) by American toad (<i>Bufo americanus</i>) and wood frog (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>) tadpoles","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s002650050438","volume":"42"},

Theory for matrix population models predicts that variance in population growth rate should be the sum of the variance in each matrix entry times the squared sensitivity term for that matrix entry. I analyzed the stage-specific demography of 30 field populations from 17 published studies for pattern between the variance of a demographic term and its contribution to population growth. There were no instances in which a matrix entry both was highly variable and had a large effect on population growth rate; instead, correlations between estimates of temporal variance in a term and contribution to population growth (sensitivity or elasticity) were overwhelmingly negative. In addition, survivorship or growth sensitivities or elasticities always exceeded those of fecundity, implying that the former two terms always contributed more to population growth rate. These results suggest that variable life history stages tend to contribute relatively little to population growth rates because natural selection may alter life histories to minimize stages with both high sensitivity and high variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pfister","given":"Catherine A."}],"citation-key":"pfister1998","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

We performed an intensive capture-markrecapture study across seasons and years to investigate the effect of chytridiomycosis on demographics in 2 populations of the threatened common mist frog (Litoria rheocola) in the lowland wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. Infection prevalence was the best predictor for apparent survival probability in adult males and varied widely with season (0–65%). Infection prevalence was highest in winter months when monthly survival probabilities were low (approximately 70%). Populations at both sites exhibited very low annual survival probabilities (12–15%) but high recruitment (71–91%), which resulted in population growth rates that fluctuated seasonally. Our results suggest that even in the absence of observed mortalities and continued declines, and despite host–pathogen co-existence for multiple host generations over almost 2 decades, chytridiomycosis continues to have substantial seasonally fluctuating population-level effects on amphibian survival, which necessitates increased recruitment for population persistence. Similarly infected populations may thus be under continued threat from chytridiomycosis which may render them vulnerable to other threatening processes, particularly those affecting recruitment success.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillott","given":"Andrea D."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Keith R."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."}],"citation-key":"phillott2013","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12073","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1058-1068","source":"Crossref","title":"Chytridiomycosis and seasonal mortality of tropical stream-associated frogs 15 years after introduction of <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i>","title-short":"Chytridiomycosis and Seasonal Mortality of Tropical Stream-Associated Frogs 15 Years after Introduction of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12073","volume":"27"},

A paucity of such background data hindered the potential for successful conservation during the global amphibian decline and remains problematic today. The current study analysed 6 years of mark-recapture data to determine the vital demographic rates in three habitat precincts of the threatened frog, Litoria aurea (Hylidae) and to understand the underlying causes of variability in population size. Variability in population size of L. aurea was similar to many pond-breeding species; however this level of ﬂuctuation is rare among threatened amphibians. Highly variable populations are at greater risk of local extinction and the low level of connectivity between L. aurea populations means they are at a greater risk of further decline due to stochastic extinction events and incapacity to recolonize distant habitat. We recommend that management of this species should encourage recolonization through creation of habitat corridors and reintroduction of L. aurea to areas where stochastic extinction events are suspected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Pickett","given":"Evan J."},{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Michelle P."},{"family":"Bower","given":"Deborah S."},{"family":"Pollard","given":"Carla J."},{"family":"Garnham","given":"James I."},{"family":"Clulow","given":"John"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"pickett2014","container-title":"Austral Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/aec.12080","ISSN":"14429985","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"244-253","source":"Crossref","title":"Six-year demographic study reveals threat of stochastic extinction for remnant populations of a threatened amphibian: Long-term demography of threatened amphibian","title-short":"Six-year demographic study reveals threat of stochastic extinction for remnant populations of a threatened amphibian","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/aec.12080","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"pilliod2003","abstract":"Information on amphibian responses to ﬁre and fuel reduction practices is critically needed due to potential declines of species and the prevalence of new, more intensive ﬁre management practices in North American forests. The goals of this review are to summarize the known and potential effects of ﬁre and fuels management on amphibians and their aquatic habitats, and to identify information gaps to help direct future scientiﬁc research. Amphibians as a group are taxonomically and ecologically diverse; in turn, responses to ﬁre and associated habitat alteration are expected to vary widely among species and among geographic regions. Available data suggest that amphibian responses to ﬁre are spatially and temporally variable and incompletely understood. Much of the limited research has addressed short-term (1–3 years) effects of prescribed ﬁre on terrestrial life stages of amphibians in the southeastern United States. Information on the long-term negative effects of ﬁre on amphibians and the importance of ﬁre for maintaining amphibian communities is sparse for the majority of taxa in North America. Given the size and severity of recent wildland ﬁres and the national effort to reduce fuels on federal lands, future studies are needed to examine the effects of these landscape disturbances on amphibians. We encourage studies to address population-level responses of amphibians to ﬁre by examining how different life stages are affected by changes in aquatic, riparian, and upland habitats. Research designs need to be credible and provide information that is relevant for ﬁre managers and those responsible for assessing the potential effects of various fuel reduction alternatives on rare, sensitive, and endangered amphibian species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pilliod","given":"David S."},{"family":"Bury","given":"R.

Preference–performance theory predicts that adults will select habitat patches that match the expected performance of their offspring in those patches. Many amphibians breed in temporary ponds immediately after they fill, and one species, Hyla chrysoscelis (Cope’s Gray Treefrogs), selects between breeding sites based on patch age differences of as little as 7 d. Prior work established that H. chrysoscelis have better larval performance in more recently filled ponds, but not in ponds less than 15 d after filling or among ponds that differed in age by less than 65 d. Our objective was to determine experimentally whether larval H. chrysoscelis performance varies across short time scales after filling (3- and 23-d-old ponds) and across two larval densities (15 and 30 larvae per mesocosm). Higher larval densities reduced metamorph mass and body condition, but did not otherwise affect larval performance. There were lower survival, shorter larval periods, and slightly lower mass and body condition among larvae from 3-d-old ponds than those in 23-d-old ponds. These mixed performance differences across our two levels of habitat age might not necessarily be representative of what happens in natural systems, however, where older ponds have more established communities of competitors and predators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pintar","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Resetarits","given":"William J."}],"citation-key":"pintar2017","container-title":"Herpetologica","DOI":"10.1655/Herpetologica-D-17-00027.1","ISSN":"0018-0831, 1938-5099","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","page":"291-296","source":"Crossref","title":"Larval development varies across pond age and larval density in Cope's gray treefrogs, <i>Hyla chrysoscelis</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1655/Herpetologica-D-17-00027.1","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"pitt2013","abstract":"Prescribed ﬁre is a commonly used management technique for maintaining ﬁre-adapted ecosystems, yet empirical data regarding its effects on amphibians are limited and contradictory. Anurans (frogs and toads) may be the amphibian taxa most negatively affected by ﬁre due to their extensive use of the forest ﬂoor; however, short-term abundance studies suggest that terrestrial toads (e.g., Anaxyrus [Bufo] americanus) may beneﬁt from ﬁre-based ecosystem management. We used radio-telemetry to examine the effects of prescribed ﬁre on movements, home range characteristics, mortality, and habitat selection of A. americanus in a southern Appalachian upland hardwood forest. We tracked 26 adult A. americanus between 27 January and 30 May 2012. Toads exhibited high non-breeding site ﬁdelity and traveled 993.5 m (±265.9 m) mean (±SD) route distance between the breeding ponds and the last recorded location within their summer habitat. We found no evidence of direct mortality of A. americanus from a prescribed ﬁre that occurred on 13 February 2012. Forward stepwise discriminant analysis (DA) revealed that the availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) was a signiﬁcant discriminator between microhabitats used (i.e., location plots) and random plots (Wilk’s lambda = 0.9852, F1, 661 = 9.9414, p = 0.002). Forward stepwise DA revealed that burned and unburned location plots were signiﬁcantly different (Wilk’s lambda = 0.2713, F1, 221 = 593.6863, p < 0.001) based on the percent of plot ground cover comprised of charred material (%char). When %char was excluded from the analysis due to its short-term nature, the percent of plot ground cover comprised of deciduous leaves, a cover item commonly used by toads in unburned locations, was the variable with the most discriminatory power (Wilk’s lambda = 0.4243, F1, 221 = 299.8741, p < 0.001). Toads maintained greater distances from CWD in the unburned (mean ± SD = 119.50 ± 109.64 cm) than in the burned locations (mean ± SD = 86.05 ± 104.81 cm; v21 ¼ 9:7055, p = 0.002). Our results indicate that prescribed ﬁre as implemented in this study did not cause direct mortality, nor did it appear to inhibit migratory movements of adult A. americanus. However, ﬁre reduced the diversity and availability of refugia, especially deciduous leaves, though the availability of alternative cover objects (e.g., CWD) in burned treatments allowed toads to inhabit those areas, suggesting the importance of noncombustible or semi-permanent refugia for A. americanus in ﬁre-managed forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pitt","given":"Amber L."},{"family":"Tavano","given":"Joseph J."},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Robert F."},{"family":"Waldrop","given":"Thomas A."}],"citation-key":"pitt2013","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.032","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"language":"en","page":"289-299","source":"Crossref","title":"Effects of fuel reduction treatments on movement and habitat use of American toads in a southern Appalachian hardwood forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112713005598","volume":"310"},

It is becoming increasingly common to analyse such data by means of matrixvariate distributions, the most prevalent of which is the matrix-variate normal distribution. Although many methods exist for assessing multivariate normality, there is a relative paucity of approaches for assessing matrix-variate normality. Herein, a new visual method is proposed for assessing matrix-variate normality by means of a distance–distance plot. In addition, a testing procedure is discussed to be used in tandem with the proposed visual method.

Florally diverse sites and generalist, small-bodied species are most important for maintaining metacommunity connectivity.

  {"id":"ponisio2020","abstract":"Improved efficiency of Markov chain Monte Carlo facilitates all aspects of statistical analysis with Bayesian hierarchical models. Identifying strategies to improve MCMC performance is becoming increasingly crucial as the complexity of models, and the run times to fit them, increases. We evaluate different strategies for improving MCMC efficiency using the open-source software NIMBLE (R package nimble) using common ecological models of species occurrence and abundance as examples. We ask how MCMC efficiency depends on model formulation, model size, data, and sampling strategy. For multiseason and/or multispecies occupancy models and for N-mixture models, we compare the efficiency of sampling discrete latent states vs. integrating over them, including more vs. fewer hierarchical model components, and univariate vs. block-sampling methods. We include the common MCMC tool JAGS in comparisons. For simple models, there is little practical difference between computational approaches. As model complexity increases, there are strong interactions between model formulation and sampling strategy on MCMC efficiency. There is no one-size-fits-all best strategy, but rather problem-specific best strategies related to model structure and type. In all but the simplest cases, NIMBLE's default or customized performance achieves much higher efficiency than JAGS. In the two most complex examples, NIMBLE was 10–12 times more efficient than JAGS. We find NIMBLE is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for complex models where JAGS is prohibitively slow. Our results highlight the need for more guidelines and customizable approaches to fit hierarchical models to ensure practitioners can make the most of occupancy and other hierarchical models. By implementing model-generic MCMC procedures in open-source software, including the NIMBLE extensions for integrating over latent states (implemented in the R package nimbleEcology), we have made progress toward this aim.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ponisio","given":"Lauren C."},{"family":"Valpine","given":"Perry"},{"family":"Michaud","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Turek","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"ponisio2020","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.6053","ISSN":"2045-7758, 2045-7758","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"en","page":"2385-2416","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"One size does not fit all: Customizing MCMC methods for hierarchical models using NIMBLE","title-short":"One size does not fit all","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6053","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"pounds1994","abstract":"The endemic golden toad (Bufo periglenes) was abundant in Costa Rica’s Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in April–May 1987 but afterwards disappeared, along with local populations of the harlequin frog (Atelopus varius). We examine the possible relationship between these sudden declines and unusually warm, dry conditions in 1987. For our analyses of local weather patterns, we define a 12-month (July–June) amphibian moisture-temperature cycle consisting of four periods: (1) late wet season; (2) transition into dry season; (3) dry season; and (4) post-dry-season (early-wet-season) recovery. The 1986–1987 cycle was the only one on record (of 20 analyzed) with abnormally low rainfall in all four periods, and temperature anomalies in 1987 reached record highs. Flow in local aquifer-fed streams during the dry season and post-dry-season recovery period reached a record low. This climate disturbance, associated with the 1986–1987 El Nino/Southern Oscillation, was more severe than a similar event associated with the 1982–1983 El Nino, though this earlier oscillation was the strongest of the past century. Demographic data for one harlequin frog population, gathered during these two climatic events, support the hypothesis that in 1987, shortly before the population collapsed, the frogs underwent an unprecedented shift in distribution within the habitat in response to desiccating conditions. The juxtaposition of these rare demographic events suggests they were causally linked yet sheds little light on mechanisms underlying the sudden decline. While desiccation or direct temperature effects may have been factors leading to high adult mortality, moisture-temperature conditions may have interacted with some other, unidentifted agent. We discuss two hypotheses concerning possible synergistic effects: In the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, microparasites are the additional agent. In the climate-linked contaminant pulse hypothesis, atmospheric contaminants scavenged by mist and cloud water in montane areas reach critical concentrations when conditions are abnormally warm and dry. \n \n \n \nEl endemico sapo dorado (Bufo periglenes) era abundante en la Reserva del bosque nuboso de Monteverde en Costa Rica durante abril–mayo 1987 pero despues desaparecio al mismo tiempo que poblaciones locales de la rana harlequin (Atelopus varius). Se examino la posible relacion entre esta subita disminucion y las condiciones calidas y secas de 1987. Para analizar los patrones locales de tiempo, se definio un ciclo de temperatura-humedad de 12 meses (julio–junio) que consiste de cuatro periodos: (1) ultimos meses de la estacion lluviosa; (2) transicion a la estacion seca; (3) estacion seca; y (4) recuperacion despues de la estacion seca (principio de la estacion lluviosa). El ciclo de 1986–1987 fue el unico registrado (de 20 analizodos) que recibio precipitacion anormalmente baja en todos los cuatro periodos, y las anomalias de temperaturas en 1987 fueron las mas altas registradas. Los caudales en las quebradas locales que se alimentan de manantiales fueron los mas bajos registrados durante la estacion seca y el periodo de recuperacion. Este trastorno del clima, asociado con El Nino/Oscilacion del sur de 1986–1987, estuvo mas severo que el evento parecido asociado con El Nino de 1982–1983, aunque esta oscilacion anterior fue la mas fuerte del ultimo siglo. Datos para una poblacion de ranas barlequines, recolectados durantes estos dos trastornos del clima, apoyan la hipotesis que en 1987, poco antes de que la poblacion colapsara, las ranas cambiaron su distribucion en el habitat en respuesta a condiciones desecantes. La yuxtaposicion de estos raros eventos demograficos sugieren que estuvieron ligados causalmente, pero dice poco de los mecanismos de la subito disminucion. Mientras que la desecacion y los efectos directos de la temperatura pudieron haber causado mortalidad de adultos, tambien es posible que hubiera interaccion entre las condiciones climaticas y otro factor. Se discuten dos hipotesis sobre una posible interaccion: En la hipotesis de epidemia ligada al clima, los microparasitos son el factor adicional. En la hipotesis de contaminacion ligada al clima, contaminantes atmosfericos removidos por la llovizna y niebla alcanzan concentraciones criticas cuando las condiciones son anormalmente calidas y secas.","author":[{"family":"Pounds","given":"J.

  {"id":"preston2020","abstract":"Predators can increase the biomass of their prey, particularly when prey life stages differ in competitive ability and predation is stage specific. Akin to predators, parasites influence host population sizes and engage in stage-structured interactions, yet whether parasites can increase host population biomass remains relatively unexplored. Using a stage-structured consumer–resource model and a mesocosm experiment with snails and castrating trematodes, we examined responses of host biomass to changes in infection prevalence under variation in host pathology and resource competition. Equilibrium adult host biomass increased with infection prevalence in the model when parasites castrated hosts and adults were superior competitors to juveniles. Juvenile biomass increased with infection prevalence whether parasites caused mortality or castration, but only when juveniles were superior competitors. In mesocosms, increases in infection by castrating trematodes reduced snail egg production, juvenile abundance, and adult survival. At high competition, juvenile growth and total biomass increased with infection prevalence due to competitive release. At low competition, juvenile biomass decreased with infection due to reduced reproduction. These results highlight how disease-induced biomass overcompensation depends on infection pathology, resource availability, and competitive interactions within and between host life stages. Considering such characteristics may benefit biocontrol efforts using parasites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Preston","given":"Daniel L."},{"family":"Sauer","given":"Erin L."}],"citation-key":"preston2020","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.3000","ISSN":"0012-9658, 1939-9170","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,28]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Infection pathology and competition mediate host biomass overcompensation from disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3000"},
  {"id":"price2019","abstract":"The global trend of increasing environmental temperatures is often predicted to result in more severe disease epidemics. However, unambiguous evidence that temperature is a driver of epidemics is largely lacking, because it is demanding to demonstrate its role among the complex interactions between hosts, pathogens and their shared environment. Here we apply a threepronged approach to understand the effects of temperature on ranavirus epidemics in common frogs, combining in vitro, in vivo and field studies. Each approach suggests that higher temperatures drive increasing severity of epidemics. In wild populations, ranavirosis incidents were more frequent and more severe at higher temperatures, and their frequency increased through a period of historic warming in the 1990s. Laboratory experiments using cell culture and whole animal models showed that higher temperature increased ranavirus propagation, disease incidence, and mortality rate. These results, combined with climate projections, predict severe ranavirosis outbreaks will occur over wider areas and an extended season, affecting larval recruitment. Since ranaviruses affect a variety of ectothermic hosts (amphibians, reptiles and fish), wider ecological damage is likely. Our three complementary lines of evidence present a clear case for direct environmental modulation of these epidemics and suggest management options to protect species from disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Price","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Leung","given":"William T.

  {"id":"puschendorf2011","abstract":"Species that are tolerant of broad environmental gradients may be less vulnerable to epizootic outbreaks of disease. Chytridriomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been linked to extirpations and extinctions of amphibian species in many regions. The pathogen thrives in cool, moist environments, and high amphibian mortality rates have commonly occurred during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in amphibian populations in high-elevation tropical rainforests. In Australia several high-elevation species, including the armored mist frog (Litoria lorica), which is designated as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), were believed to have gone extinct during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in the 1980s and early 1990s. Species with greater elevational ranges disappeared from higher elevations, but remained common in the lowlands. In June 2008, we surveyed a stream in a high-elevation dry sclerophyll forest and discovered a previously unknown population of L. lorica and a population of the waterfall frog (Litoria nannotis). We conducted 6 additional surveys in June 2008, September 2008, March 2009, and August 2009. Prevalences of B. dendrobatidis infection (number infected per total sampled) were consistently high in frogs (mean 82.5%, minimum 69%) of both species and in tadpoles (100%) during both winter (starting July) and summer (starting February). However, no individuals of either species showed clinical signs of disease, and they remained abundant (3.25 – 8.75 individuals of L. lorica and 6.5–12.5 individuals of L. nannotis found/person/100 m over 13 months). The high-elevation dry sclerophyll site had little canopy cover, low annual precipitation, and a more defined dry season than a nearby rainforest site, where L. nannotis was more negatively affected by chytridiomycosis. We hypothesize this lack of canopy cover allowed the rocks on which frogs perched to warm up, thereby slowing growth and reproduction of the pathogen on the hosts. In addition, we suggest surveys for apparently extinct or rare species should not be limited to core environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Puschendorf","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Hoskin","given":"Conrad J."},{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Vanderwal","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."}],"citation-key":"puschendorf2011","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01728.x","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",10]]},"language":"en","page":"956-964","source":"Crossref","title":"Environmental refuge from disease-driven amphibian extinction","title-short":"Environmental Refuge from Disease-Driven Amphibian Extinction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01728.x","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"quick2015","abstract":"In the wake of the global decline in amphibians there is a need for long-term population monitoring. Previous research suggested that the endangered Fleay’s barred frog (Mixophyes ﬂeayi) had recovered after a severe decline. We aimed to determine whether this recovery has been sustained and to test an example of a monitoring program that could be employed at intervals of ﬁve or more years to assess long-term population stability. We conducted capture–mark–recapture ﬁve years after the last detailed census at Brindle Creek in Border Ranges National Park, New South Wales. Frogs were captured along a 200 m creek transect between September 2013 and February 2014. We used program MARK to estimate demographic parameters of adult male frogs using two modelling approaches: robust design (RD) and the POPAN formulation of the Jolly–Seber model. Abundance was estimated at 38.2 Æ 0.5 (s.e.) (RD) and 46.0 Æ 2.7 (POPAN). Abundance in 2008 was estimated at 53.2 Æ 10.0 (POPAN) male frogs. Estimates of apparent monthly survival over our ﬁve-month-long study were very high (RD: 1.0 Æ 0.0; POPAN: 1.0 Æ 0.02). Recapture estimates were also high (RD: 0.40 Æ 0.07 to 0.72 Æ 0.05 per session; POPAN: 0.84 Æ 0.05 per month).

  {"id":"raberg2009","abstract":"Plant biologists have long recognized that host defence against parasites and pathogens can be divided into two conceptually different components: the ability to limit parasite burden (resistance) and the ability to limit the harm caused by a given burden (tolerance). Together these two components determine how well a host is protected against the effects of parasitism. This distinction is useful because it recognizes that hosts that are best at controlling parasite burdens are not necessarily the healthiest. Moreover, resistance and tolerance can be expected to have different effects on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and host–parasite coevolution. However, studies of defence in animals have to date focused on resistance, whereas the possibility of tolerance and its implications have been largely overlooked. The aim of our review is to (i) describe the statistical framework for analysis of tolerance developed in plant science and how this can be applied to animals, (ii) review evidence of genetic and environmental variation for tolerance in animals, and studies indicating which mechanisms could contribute to this variation, and (iii) outline avenues for future research on this topic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Råberg","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Andrea L"},{"family":"Read","given":"Andrew F"}],"citation-key":"raberg2009","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

We also show that R. muscosa tadpoles appear healthy with B. dendrobatidis infection, while postmetamorphic animals experience mortality. In addition, we provide guidelines for visually detecting B. dendrobatidis in R. muscosa tadpoles, which may be useful in other affected species.

  {"id":"raffel2013","abstract":"Global climate change is shifting the distribution of infectious diseases of humans and wildlife with potential adverse consequences for disease control1,2,3,4. As well as increasing mean temperatures, climate change is expected to increase climate variability5,6, making climate less predictable. However, few empirical or theoretical studies have considered the effects of climate variability or predictability on disease, despite it being likely that hosts and parasites will have differential responses to climatic shifts6,7. Here we present a theoretical framework for how temperature variation and its predictability influence disease risk by affecting host and parasite acclimation responses. Laboratory experiments conducted in 80 independent incubators, and field data on disease-associated frog declines in Latin America6, support the framework and provide evidence that unpredictable temperature fluctuations, on both monthly and diurnal timescales, decrease frog resistance to the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Furthermore, the pattern of temperature-dependent growth of the fungus on frogs was opposite to the pattern of growth in culture, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the host–parasite interaction when predicting climate-dependent disease dynamics. If similar acclimation responses influence other host–parasite systems, as seems likely, then present models, which generally ignore small-scale temporal variability in climate7, might provide poor predictions for climate effects on disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Raffel","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Romansic","given":"John M."},{"family":"Halstead","given":"Neal T."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Taegan A."},{"family":"Venesky","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."}],"citation-key":"raffel2013","container-title":"Nature Climate Change","DOI":"10.1038/nclimate1659","ISSN":"1758-6798","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"language":"en","page":"146-151","source":"www-nature-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au","title":"Disease and thermal acclimation in a more variable and unpredictable climate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1659","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"ramesh2022","abstract":"Disentangling associations between species occupancy and its environmental drivers –– climate and land cover –– along tropical mountains is imperative to predict species distributional changes in the future. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying such associations in temperate mountain systems. Using 1.29 million robustly processed citizen science observations contributed to eBird between 2013 and 2021, we examined the role of climatic and landscape variables and its association with bird species occurrence within a tropical biodiversity hotspot, the southern Western Ghats in India. Using an occupancy modeling framework, we found that temperature seasonality, precipitation seasonality, and the proportion of evergreen forests were significantly associated with species-specific probabilities of occupancy for 78% (n=43 birds), 38% (n=21 birds), and 27% (n=15 birds) of bird species examined, respectively. Our study shows that several forest birds (n=18 species) were negatively associated with temperature seasonality, highlighting narrow thermal niches for such species. The probability of occupancy of six forest species and eight generalist species was positively associated with precipitation seasonality, indicating potential associations between rainfall and resource availability, and thereby, species occurrence. A smaller number of largely generalist species (n=9 birds) were positively associated with human-modified land cover types –– including the proportion of agriculture/settlements and plantations. Our study shows that rigorously filtered citizen science observations can be used to identify associations between environmental drivers and species occupancy on tropical mountains. Though current distributions of tropical montane birds of the Western Ghats are strongly associated with climatic factors (mainly, temperature seasonality), naturally occurring land cover types (forests) are critical to sustaining montane avifauna across human-modified landscapes in the long run.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Gupte","given":"Pratik Rajan"},{"family":"Tingley","given":"Morgan W."},{"family":"Robin","given":"V.

  {"id":"rankin2016","abstract":"We present a Hierarchical Bayesian version of Pollock’s Closed Robust Design for studying the survival, temporary migration, and abundance of marked animals. Through simulations and analyses of a bottlenose dolphin photo-identiﬁcation dataset, we compare several estimation frameworks, including Maximum Likelihood estimation (ML), model-averaging by AICc, as well as Bayesian and Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) procedures. Our results demonstrate a number of advantages of the Bayesian framework over other popular methods. First, for simple ﬁxed-effect models, we show the near-equivalence of Bayesian and ML point-estimates and conﬁdence/credibility intervals. Second, we demonstrate how there is an inherent correlation among temporary migration and survival parameter estimates in the PCRD, and while this can lead to serious convergence issues and singularities among MLEs, we show that the Bayesian estimates were more reliable. Third, we demonstrate that a Hierarchical Bayesian model with carefully thought-out hyperpriors, can lead to similar parameter estimates and conclusions as multi-model inference by AICc model-averaging. This latter point is especially interesting for mark-recapture practitioners, for whom model-uncertainty and multi-model inference have become a major preoccupation. Lastly, we extend the Hierarchical Bayesian PCRD to include full-capture histories (i.e., by modeling a recruitment process) and individual-level heterogeneity in detection probabilities, which can have important consequences for the range of phenomena studied by the PCRD, as well as lead to large differences in abundance estimates. For example, we estimate 8–24% more bottlenose dolphins in the western gulf of Shark Bay than previously estimated by ML and AICc-based model-averaging. Other important extensions are discussed.

  {"id":"ranvestel2004","abstract":"1. Few studies have assessed the role of tadpoles in tropical streams, although they are often abundant and conspicuous components of these systems. Moreover, amphibian populations are declining around the globe, particularly stream-dwelling species in tropical uplands, and the ecological consequences of these losses are not understood. 2. We chose a stream in the central Panamanian highlands, which has an intact fauna of stream-breeding anurans, to examine the ecological consequences of amphibian losses. This site differs dramatically from sites in nearby western Panama and Costa Rica where anuran diversity and abundance have declined greatly in the last two decades. 3. We used an underwater electric field to create tadpole exclosures in runs, so that we could evaluate their influence on sediment dynamics and the abundance and community structure of algae and aquatic insects. Tadpoles reduced total sediments and both organic and inorganic fractions on substrata. Tadpoles also reduced algal abundance on substrata by approximately 50% and decreased algal biovolume. Gut content analyses showed that tadpoles consumed algae and sediments and we could see that algae and sediments were also displaced through bioturbation. 4. Atelopus zeteki, Rana warszewitschii, and Hyla spp. were the dominant larval anurans responsible for the effects observed. Visual surveys indicated that the densities of these taxa ranged from 23 (R. warszewitschii and Hyla spp. combined) to 43 m−2 (A. zeteki) in runs. 5. The abundance of baetid mayflies was lower in tadpole exclosures compared with controls, and this was attributed to tadpoles facilitating mayfly feeding by removing sediments and exposing underlying periphyton. 6. Tadpoles affect the abundance and diversity of basal resources and other primary consumers, and thus influence food web dynamics and energy flow in these tropical streams. Catastrophic decline in stream-breeding anuran populations will influence the structure and function of neotropical stream ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ranvestel","given":"Anthony W."},{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."},{"family":"Pringle","given":"Catherine M."},{"family":"Whiles","given":"Matt R."},{"family":"Bixby","given":"Rebecca J."}],"citation-key":"ranvestel2004","container-title":"Freshwater Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01184.x","ISSN":"1365-2427","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"274-285","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Neotropical tadpoles influence stream benthos: evidence for the ecological consequences of decline in amphibian populations","title-short":"Neotropical tadpoles influence stream benthos","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01184.x","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"reeder2012","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is driving amphibian declines and extinctions in protected areas globally. The introduction of invasive reservoir species has been implicated in the spread of Bd but does not explain the appearance of the pathogen in remote protected areas. In the high elevation (.1500 m) Sierra Nevada of California, the native Pacific chorus frog, Pseudacris regilla, appears unaffected by chytridiomycosis while sympatric species experience catastrophic declines. We investigated whether P. regilla is a reservoir of Bd by comparing habitat occupancy before and after a major Bd outbreak and measuring infection in P. regilla in the field, monitoring susceptibility of P. regilla to Bd in the laboratory, examining tissues with histology to determine patterns of infection, and using an innovative soak technique to determine individual output of Bd zoospores in water. Pseudacris regilla persists at 100% of sites where a sympatric species has been extirpated from 72% in synchrony with a wave of Bd. In the laboratory, P. regilla carried loads of Bd as much as an order of magnitude higher than loads found lethal to sympatric species. Histology shows heavy Bd infection in patchy areas next to normal skin, a possible mechanism for tolerance. The soak technique was 77.8% effective at detecting Bd in water and showed an average output of 68 zoospores per minute per individual. The results of this study suggest P. regilla should act as a Bd reservoir and provide evidence of a tolerance mechanism in a reservoir species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Reeder","given":"Natalie M.

  {"id":"rees2019","abstract":"Effective invasive predator management requires accurate knowledge of population density. However, density can be difficult to estimate for wide-ranging, cryptic and trap-shy species, such as the feral cat Felis catus. Consequently, few density estimates exist for this invasive predator of global significance, particularly from rugged, mesic or structurally complex habitats where detection is challenging. In this study, we estimated feral cat density in the wet forests and cool temperate rainforests of the Otway Ranges, south-eastern Australia, to (1) provide a density estimate for this rarely surveyed habitat type, and (2) verify predictions from a continentalscale model of feral cat density. We deployed 140 camera traps across two independent 49 km2 grids and identified individual feral cats based on unique pelage markings. Using spatially explicit mark-resight models, we estimated that there were 1.14 cats km−2 (95% CI: 0.89–1.47). This is more than three times the average cat density in natural environments across Australia, and at least five times higher than model-based predictions for the Otway Ranges. Such high densities of feral cats likely reflect the abundance of small native mammals and lack of apex predators in our study area. Our findings contradict the widespread assumption that feral cats occur at very low densities in mesic and rugged habitats. Underestimating the density of feral cats in these environments has significant implications for pest animal management and biodiversity conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rees","given":"M.W."},{"family":"Pascoe","given":"J.H."},{"family":"Wintle","given":"B.A."},{"family":"Le Pla","given":"M."},{"family":"Birnbaum","given":"E.K."},{"family":"Hradsky","given":"B.A."}],"citation-key":"rees2019","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108287","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"language":"en","page":"108287","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unexpectedly high densities of feral cats in a rugged temperate forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320719312674","volume":"239"},
  {"id":"refsnider2015","abstract":"Emerging infectious diseasespose a signiﬁcant threat to global health, but predicting disease outcomes for particular species can be complicated when pathogen virulence varies across space, time, or hosts. The pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused worldwide declines in frog populations. Not only do Bd isolates from wild populations vary in virulence, but virulence shifts can occur over short timescales when Bd is maintained in the laboratory. We leveraged changes in Bd virulence over multiple generations of passage to better understand mechanisms of pathogen virulence. We conducted whole-genome resequencing of two samples of the same Bd isolate, differing only in passage history, to identify genomic processes associated with virulence attenuation. The isolate with shorter passage history (and greater virulence) had greater chromosome copy numbers than the isolate maintained in culture for longer, suggesting that virulence attenuation may be associated with loss of chromosome copies. Our results suggest that genomic processes proposed as mechanisms for rapid evolution in Bd are correlated with virulence attenuation in laboratory culture within a single lineage of Bd. Moreover, these genomic processes can occur over extremely short timescales. On a practical level, our results underscore the importance of immediately cryo-archiving new Bd isolates and using fresh isolates, rather than samples cultured in the laboratory for long periods, for laboratory infection experiments. Finally, when attempting to predict disease outcomes for this ecologically important pathogen, it is critical to consider existing variation in virulence among isolates and the potential for shifts in virulence over short timescales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Refsnider","given":"Jeanine M."},{"family":"Poorten","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Langhammer","given":"Penny F."},{"family":"Burrowes","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Rosenblum","given":"Erica Bree"}],"citation-key":"refsnider2015","container-title":"Genes|Genomes|Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/g3.115.021808","ISSN":"2160-1836","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","page":"2291-2298","source":"Crossref","title":"Genomic correlates of virulence attenuation in the deadly amphibian chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://g3journal.org/lookup/doi/10.1534/g3.115.021808","volume":"5"},

In the current study, we assessed the effectiveness of fully-automated and semi-automated software: Wild-ID and APHIS. We used the cryptic salamander Hydromantes strinatii as our study species. We used the False Rejection Rate (FRR) of Top 1, Top 5 and Top 10 matches of chest and cloaca pictures. Finally, we assessed the bias induced by our FRR for the estimation of population size through simulation. Wild-ID FRRs ranged from 0.042 to 0.093 while APHIS’ ranged from 0.227 to 0.547. Wild-ID was equally efficient with pictures from the chest and from the cloaca, while APHIS was significantly more efficient with chest pictures than cloaca pictures. Cropping pictures did not significantly improve Wild-ID effectiveness. Our Wild-ID FRRs are among the lowest ever obtained from pictures of an amphibian with a complex chromatophore pattern. Simulation showed that the Top 10 FRR from selected software Wild-ID induced a low bias 2.7% on the estimation of population size.

We evaluated a technique for non-lethal Bd diagnosis using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on swabs scraped over the mouthparts of live tadpoles. The sensitivity of non-lethal (swabbing) and lethal (removal of mouthparts) sampling was assessed using 150 Bd-infected Rana subaquavocalis tadpoles. Swabbing was consistently less sensitive than lethal sampling, but still detected Bd. Experimental Bd prevalence was 41.1% when estimated by destructively sampling mouthparts and 4.7 to 36.6% (mean = 21.4%) when estimated with swabs. Detection rates from swabbing varied with investigator and time since infection. The likelihood of detecting Bd-infected tadpoles was similar regardless of size and developmental stage. Swabbing mouthparts of live tadpoles is a feasible and effective survey technique for Bd, but, because it is less sensitive, more tadpoles must be sampled to estimate prevalence at a confidence level comparable to destructive sampling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Retallick","given":"Richard W.

  {"id":"rhodes2005","abstract":"Understanding habitat selection is of primary interest in theoretical and applied ecology. One approach is to infer habitat selection processes from differences in population densities between habitats using methods such as isodar and isoleg analysis. Another approach is to directly observe the movements of individuals. However, habitat selection models based on movement data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial processes. This is problematic if the probability of selecting a particular habitat is dependent upon its spatial context. This would occur, for example, where organisms exhibit home range behavior and the choice of habitat is dependent on its location relative to the home range. In this paper we present a spatially explicit habitat selection model for movement data that incorporates home range behavior as a spatial process. Our approach extends a previous model by formulating the probability of selecting a habitat as a function of its distance from the animal's current location and home range center. We demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more parsimonious models when applied to a koala radio-tracking data set from eastern Australia. This approach could also be applied to modeling other spatial habitat selection processes, leading to more biologically meaningful models for a range of species and applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rhodes","given":"Jonathan R."},{"family":"McAlpine","given":"Clive A."},{"family":"Lunney","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Possingham","given":"Hugh P."}],"citation-key":"rhodes2005","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/04-0912","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"1199-1205","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A spatially explicit habitat selection model incorporating home range behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/04-0912","volume":"86"},

Since the 1960s, the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) has undergone extensive declines in heavily urbanized southern California, where the range edge has rapidly contracted northward while shifting its cardinal orientation to an east-west trending axis. We studied the genetic structure and diversity of these frontline populations, tested for signatures of contemporary disturbance, speciﬁcally ﬁre, and attempted to disentangle these signals from demographic events extending deeper into the past. Consistent with the genetic expectations of the ‘abundant-center’ model, we found that diversity, admixture, and opportunity for random mating increases in populations sampled successively further away from the range boundary. Demographic simulations indicate that bottlenecks in peripheral isolates are associated with processes extending tens to a few hundred generations in the past, despite the demographic collapse of some due to recent ﬁre-ﬂood events. While the effects of recent disturbance have left little genetic imprint on these populations, they likely contribute to an extinction debt that will lead to continued range contraction unless management intervenes to stall or reverse the process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Richmond","given":"Jonathan Q."},{"family":"Barr","given":"Kelly R."},{"family":"Backlin","given":"Adam R."},{"family":"Vandergast","given":"Amy G."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Robert N."}],"citation-key":"richmond2013","container-title":"Evolutionary Applications","DOI":"10.1111/eva.12067","ISSN":"17524571","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","page":"808-822","source":"Crossref","title":"Evolutionary dynamics of a rapidly receding southern range boundary in the threatened California Red-Legged Frog (<i>Rana draytonii</i>)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/eva.12067","volume":"6"},

Molecular methods allow unique genetic ﬁngerprints to be established for individuals. Although microsatellite markers have successfully been applied in mark–recapture studies on several animal species, they have never been previously used in amphibians to follow individuals across different life cycle stages. Here, we evaluate microsatellites for genetic across-stages mark–recapture studies in amphibians and test the suitability of available software packages for genotype matching. We sampled tadpoles of the dendrobatid frog Allobates femoralis, which we introduced on a river island in the Nature Reserve ‘Les Nouragues’ in French Guiana. In two subsequent recapture sessions, we searched for surviving juveniles and adults, respectively. All individuals were genotyped at 14 highly variable microsatellite loci, which yielded unique genetic ﬁngerprints for all individuals. We found large differences in the identiﬁcation success of the programs tested. The pairwise-relatedness-based approach, conducted with the programs KINGROUP or ML-Relate, performed best with our data set. Matching ventral patterns of juveniles and adult individuals acted as a control for the reliability of the genetic identiﬁcation. Our results demonstrate that microsatellite markers are a highly powerful tool for studying amphibian populations on an individual basis. The ability to individually track amphibian tadpoles throughout metamorphosis until adulthood will be of substantial value for future studies on amphibian population ecology and evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ringler","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Mangione","given":"Rosanna"},{"family":"Ringler","given":"Max"}],"citation-key":"ringler2015","container-title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","DOI":"10.1111/1755-0998.12345","ISSN":"1755098X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"language":"en","page":"737-746","source":"Crossref","title":"Where have all the tadpoles gone?

However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Riutort-Mayol","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Bürkner","given":"Paul-Christian"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Solin","given":"Arno"},{"family":"Vehtari","given":"Aki"}],"citation-key":"riutort-mayol2023","container-title":"Statistics and Computing","container-title-short":"Stat Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s11222-022-10167-2","ISSN":"0960-3174, 1573-1375","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Practical Hilbert space approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes for probabilistic programming","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11222-022-10167-2","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"rivera-ordonez2019","abstract":"The conversion of natural habitats to human land uses often increases local temperatures, creating novel thermal environments for species. The variable responses of ectotherms to habitat conversion, where some species decline while others persist, can partly be explained by variation among species in their thermal niches. However, few studies have examined thermal niche variation within species and across forest‐land use ecotones, information that could provide clues about the capacity of species to adapt to changing temperatures. Here, we quantify individual‐level variation in thermal traits of the tropical poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in thermally contrasting habitats. Specifically, we examined local environmental temperatures, field body temperatures (Tb), preferred body temperatures (Tpref), critical thermal maxima (CTmax), and thermal safety margins (TSM) of individuals from warm, converted habitats and cool forests. We found that frogs from converted habitats exhibited greater mean Tb and Tpref than those from forests. In contrast, CTmax and TSM did not differ significantly between habitats. However, CTmax did increase moderately with increasing Tb, suggesting that changes in CTmax may be driven by microscale temperature exposure within habitats rather than by mean habitat conditions. Although O. pumilio exhibited moderate divergence in Tpref, CTmax appears to be less labile between habitats, possibly due to the ability of frogs in converted habitats to maintain their Tb below air temperatures that reach or exceed CTmax. Selective pressures on thermal tolerances may increase, however, with the loss of buffering microhabitats and increased frequency of extreme temperatures expected under future habitat degradation and climate warming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rivera‐Ordonez","given":"Juana M."},{"family":"Justin Nowakowski","given":"A."},{"family":"Manansala","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Michelle E."},{"family":"Todd","given":"Brian D."}],"citation-key":"rivera-ordonez2019","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12691","ISSN":"0006-3606, 1744-7429","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9]]},"language":"en","page":"747-756","source":"Crossref","title":"Thermal niche variation among individuals of the poison frog, <i>Oophaga pumilio</i>, in forest and converted habitats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12691","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"robak2018","abstract":"Defense against pathogens is one of many beneﬁts that bacteria provide to animal hosts. A clearer understanding of how changes in the environment affect the interactions between animals and their microbial benefactors is needed in order to predict the impact and dynamics of emerging animal diseases. Due to its dramatic effects on the physiology of animals and their pathogens, temperature may be a key variable modulating the level of protection that beneﬁcial bacteria provide to their animal hosts. Here we investigate how temperature and the makeup of the skin microbial community affect the susceptibility of amphibian hosts to infection by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), one of two fungal pathogens known to cause the disease chytridiomycosis. To do this, we manipulated the skin bacterial communities of susceptible hosts, northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans), prior to exposing these animals to Bd under two different ecologically relevant temperatures. Our manipulations included one treatment where antibiotics were used to reduce the skin bacterial community, one where the bacterial community was augmented with the antifungal bacterium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and one in which the frog’s skin bacterial community was left intact. We predicted that frogs with reduced skin bacterial communities would be more susceptible (i.e., less resistant to and/or tolerant of Bd infection), and frogs with skin bacterial communities augmented with the known antifungal bacterium would be less susceptible to Bd infection and chytridiomycosis. However, we also predicted that this interaction would be temperature dependent. We found a strong effect of temperature but not of skin microbial treatment on the probability and intensity of infection in Bd-exposed frogs. Whether temperature affected survival; however, it differed among our skin microbial treatment groups, with animals having more S. maltophilia on their skin surviving longer at 14 but not at 26◦C. Our results suggest that temperature was the predominant factor inﬂuencing Bd’s ability to colonize the host (i.e., resistance) but that the composition of the cutaneous bacterial community was important in modulating the host’s ability to survive (i.e., tolerate) a heavy Bd infection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Robak","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Richards-Zawacki","given":"Corinne L."}],"citation-key":"robak2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2018.00410","ISSN":"1664-302X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,7]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Temperature-dependent effects of cutaneous bacteria on a frog’s tolerance of fungal infection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00410/full","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"robertson2018","abstract":"Fire regimes influence natural populations of organisms in diverse ways, via direct effects on population dynamics as well as indirect effects on habitat and ecosystem processes. Although many amphibian species have evolved to persist in fire-dependent ecosystems, the effects of fire on the genetic diversity of amphibian populations remain relatively unexplored. We examined how different aspects of fire history relate to population genetic diversity and structure of an abundant anuran, Hyla femoralis, in a large, intact area of Florida scrub containing hundreds of seasonally inundated ponds. Specifically, we assessed the overall population genetic structure and examined whether variation in time since fire, fire intensity, or historical fire frequency at breeding sites explained spatial variation in genetic diversity. Based on our sampling of 17 breeding aggregations within the 2,100-ha study area, neither recent nor frequent fire reduce genetic diversity or restrict connectivity among ponds for H. femoralis. Overall, mean effective population sizes were large (average range = 68–572). We detected a positive trend between effective population size (Ne) and average intensity of the most-recent fire, with this factor explaining 42% of the variation in Ne. Our results contrast with previous studies that consistently demonstrate strong relationships between fire history and population genetic structure of scrub-associated lizard species, suggesting that H. femoralis is resilient to a wide range of fire regimes. More generally, our study contributes to understanding the roles of life-history characteristics and environmental unpredictability in shaping organisms’ responses to fire.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Robertson","given":"Jeanne M."},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Sarah W."},{"family":"Rothermel","given":"Betsie B."},{"family":"Chan","given":"Lauren M."}],"citation-key":"robertson2018","container-title":"Journal of Heredity","DOI":"10.1093/jhered/esx088","editor":[{"family":"Shaffer","given":"H.

  {"id":"rodder2008","abstract":"Chydridiomycosis is an infectious emerging disease in amphibians that has been directly linked to mass mortality, drastic population decline and extinction. The understanding of the factors limiting the distribution and the abundance of its biological agent, the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd ), is still limited. It has been suggested that climate plays a key role. A recent study conducted infection surveys at 31 lowland sites on the Australian East coast and searched for climatic variables explaining Bd prevalence and intensity in Stony creek frogs Litoria lesueuri (complex). A link between the prevalence of infections and latitude was advocated, exclusively focusing on the pathogen. Beyond this, the prevalence and intensity of Bd infection may also depend on the climatic suitability of a given site for the amphibian host. Herein, we extend the previous study using a set of long-term bioclimatic variables and assess climatic suitability for Stony creek frogs at the sites previously studied for Bd. We ran a Climatic Envelope Model for our target amphibian based on those variables with the most explanatory power for prevalence and intensity, thus representing the link between climatic suitability for both the pathogen and the host. Our ﬁndings allow the hypothesis that there exists a signiﬁcant correlation between climatic suitability for Stony creek frogs at the previously studied sites and latitude. At the same time, this was congruent with the latitudinal gradient of the number of zoospores per frog.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Rödder","given":"D."},{"family":"Veith","given":"M."},{"family":"Lötters","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"rodder2008","container-title":"Animal Conservation","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00210.x","ISSN":"13679430, 14691795","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12]]},"language":"en","page":"513-517","source":"Crossref","title":"Environmental gradients explaining the prevalence and intensity of infection with the amphibian chytrid fungus: the host's perspective","title-short":"Environmental gradients explaining the prevalence and intensity of infection with the amphibian chytrid fungus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00210.x","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"rodriguez-caro2021","abstract":"Animal populations have developed multiple strategies to deal with environmental change. Among them, the demographic buffering strategy consists in constraining the temporal variation of the vital rate(s) that most affect(s) the overall performance of the population. Tortoises are known to buffer their temporal variation in adult survival, which typically has the highest contribution to the population growth rate λ, at the expense of a high variability on reproductive rates, which contribute far less to λ. To identify the effects of projected increases in droughts in its natural habitat, we use field data collected across 15 locations of Testudo graeca in southeast Spain over a decade. We analyse the effects of environmental variables on reproduction rates. In addition, we couple the demographic and environmental data to parameterise an integral projection model to simulate the effects of different scenarios of drought recurrence on λ under different degrees of intensity in the survival–reproduction tradeoff. We find that droughts negatively affect the probability of laying eggs; however, the overall effects on λ under the current drought recurrence (one/decade) are negligible when survival is constant (independent of the reduction of reproduction by drought events) and when survival increased as a tradeoff with the reduction of reproduction rates, with a threshold to population viability at three or more droughts/decade. Additionally, we show that, although some species may buffer current environmental regimes by carefully orchestrating how their vital rates vary through time, a demographic buffering strategy is insufficient to ensure population viability in extreme regimes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the demographic buffering strategy has a limit of effectiveness when adverse conditions occur frequently. Our methodological approach provides a framework for ecologists to determine how effective the management of environmental drivers can be for demographically buffering populations, and which scenarios may not provide long-term population persistence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Caro","given":"Roberto C."},{"family":"Capdevila","given":"Pol"},{"family":"Graciá","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Barbosa","given":"Jomar M."},{"family":"Giménez","given":"Andrés"},{"family":"Salguero-Gómez","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"rodriguez-caro2021","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/oik.08343","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1346-1358","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The limits of demographic buffering in coping with environmental variation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.08343","volume":"130"},

  {"id":"rose2021","abstract":"Demographic models enhance understanding of drivers of population growth and inform conservation efforts to prevent population declines and extinction. For species with complex life histories, however, parameterizing demographic models is challenging because some life stages can be difﬁcult to study directly. Integrated population models (IPMs) empower researchers to estimate vital rates for organisms that have cryptic or widely dispersing early life stages by integrating multiple demographic data sources. For a stream-inhabiting frog (Rana boylii) that is declining through much of its range in Oregon and California, USA, we collected egg-mass counts and capture–mark–recapture data on adults from two populations in California to ﬁt IPMs that estimate adult abundance and the survival rate of both marked and unobserved life stages. Estimates of adult abundance based on long-term monitoring of egg-mass counts showed that study populations ﬂuctuated greatly inter-annually but were stable at longer timescales (i.e., decades). Adult female survival during 5–6 yr of capture–mark–recapture study periods was nearly equal in each population. Survival rate of R. boylii eggs to the subadult stage is low on average (0.002) but highly variable among years depending on post-oviposition stream ﬂow. Population viability analysis showed that survival of adult and subadult life stages has the greatest proportional effect on population growth; the survival of egg and tadpole life stages, however, is more malleable by management interventions. For example, simulations showed head-starting of tadpoles, salvaging stranded egg masses, and limiting aseasonal pulsed ﬂows could dramatically reduce the threat of extirpation. This study demonstrates the value of integrating multiple demographic data sources to construct models of population dynamics in species with complex life histories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Rose","given":"Jonathan P."},{"family":"Kupferberg","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Wheeler","given":"Clara A."},{"family":"Kleeman","given":"Patrick M."},{"family":"Halstead","given":"Brian J."}],"citation-key":"rose2021","container-title":"Ecosphere","container-title-short":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.3381","ISSN":"2150-8925, 2150-8925","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Estimating the survival of unobservable life stages for a declining frog with a complex life history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3381","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"rossi2011","abstract":"Background: The understanding of host-parasite systems in wildlife is of increasing interest in relation to the risk of emerging diseases in livestock and humans. In this respect, many efforts have been dedicated to controlling classical swine fever (CSF) in the European Wild Boar. But CSF eradication has not always been achieved even though vaccination has been implemented at a large-scale. Piglets have been assumed to be the main cause of CSF persistence in the wild since they appeared to be more often infected and less often immune than older animals. However, this assumption emerged from laboratory trials or cross-sectional surveys based on the hunting bags.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: In the present paper we conducted a capture-mark-recapture study in free-ranging wild boar piglets that experienced both CSF infection and vaccination under natural conditions. We used multi-state capture recapture models to estimate the immunization and infection rates, and their variations according to the periods with or without vaccination. According to the model prediction, 80% of the infected piglets did not survive more than two weeks, while the other 20% quickly recovered. The probability of becoming immune did not increase significantly during the summer vaccination sessions, and the proportion of immune piglets was not higher after the autumn vaccination.\nConclusions/Significance: Given the high lethality of CSF in piglets highlighted in our study, we consider unlikely that piglets could maintain the chain of CSF virus transmission. Our study also revealed the low efficacy of vaccination in piglets in summer and autumn, possibly due to the low palatability of baits to that age class, but also to the competition between baits and alternative food sources. Based on this new information, we discuss the prospects for the improvement of CSF control and the interest of the capture-recapture approach for improving the understanding of wildlife diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossi","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Toigo","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Hars","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Pol","given":"Françoise"},{"family":"Hamann","given":"Jean-Luc"},{"family":"Depner","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Le Potier","given":"Marie-Frederique"}],"citation-key":"rossi2011","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0024257","editor":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Michael George"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e24257","source":"Crossref","title":"New insights on the management of wildlife diseases using multi-state recapture models: the case of classical swine fever in wild boar","title-short":"New insights on the management of wildlife diseases using multi-state recapture models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024257","volume":"6"},

Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

  {"id":"royle2004","abstract":"Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is diﬃcult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-speciﬁc population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423–426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are ﬁxed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, conﬁdence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially diﬀerent estimates of abundance as a consequence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

Such models have become widely adopted in surveys of many taxa. The most fundamental assumption underlying these models is that ‘‘false positive’’ errors are not possible. That is, one cannot detect a species where it does not occur. However, such errors are possible in many sampling situations for a number of reasons, and even low false positive error rates can induce extreme bias in estimates of site occupancy when they are not accounted for. In this paper, we develop a model for site occupancy that allows for both false negative and false positive error rates. This model can be represented as a two-component ﬁnite mixture model and can be easily ﬁtted using freely available software. We provide an analysis of avian survey data using the proposed model and present results of a brief simulation study evaluating the performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator and the naive estimator in the presence of false positive errors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

  {"id":"royle2007","abstract":"Species occurrence and its dynamic components, extinction and colonization probabilities, are focal quantities in biogeography and metapopulation biology, and for species conservation assessments. It has been increasingly appreciated that these parameters must be estimated separately from detection probability to avoid the biases induced by non-detection error. Hence, there is now considerable theoretical and practical interest in dynamic occupancy models that contain explicit representations of metapopulation dynamics such as extinction, colonization, and turnover as well as growth rates. We describe a hierarchical parameterization of these models that is analogous to the state-space formulation of models in time series, where the model is represented by two components, one for the partially observable occupancy process and another for the observations conditional on that process. This parameterization naturally allows estimation of all parameters of the conventional approach to occupancy models, but in addition, yields great flexibility and extensibility, e.g., to modeling heterogeneity or latent structure in model parameters. We also highlight the important distinction between population and finite sample inference; the latter yields much more precise estimates for the particular sample at hand. Finite sample estimates can easily be obtained using the state-space representation of the model but are difficult to obtain under the conventional approach of likelihood-based estimation. We use R and WinBUGS to apply the model to two examples. In a standard analysis for the European Crossbill in a large Swiss monitoring program, we fit a model with year-specific parameters. Estimates of the dynamic parameters varied greatly among years, highlighting the irruptive population dynamics of that species. In the second example, we analyze route occupancy of Cerulean Warblers in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) using a model allowing for site-specific heterogeneity in model parameters. The results indicate relatively low turnover and a stable distribution of Cerulean Warblers which is in contrast to analyses of counts of individuals from the same survey that indicate important declines. This discrepancy illustrates the inertia in occupancy relative to actual abundance. Furthermore, the model reveals a declining patch survival probability, and increasing turnover, toward the edge of the range of the species, which is consistent with metapopulation perspectives on the genesis of range edges. Given detection/non-detection data, dynamic occupancy models as described here have considerable potential for the study of distributions and range dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Royle","given":"J.

However, one important limitation is that these dataloggers are not waterproof, which can lead to device failure and loss of data under field conditions. Several methods have been used to increase their water resistance, but no study to date has investigated whether any of these techniques affects the accuracy of temperature readings. Waterproofing potentially could affect the accuracy of iButtons by biasing temperatures or altering rates of warming and cooling. We compared temperature profiles of unmodified Thermochron iButtons (model DS1921G) to iButtons that we coated with a clear plastic dip (designed to coat tool handles) to determine whether this waterproof coating affects the accuracy of temperatures they record. We also compared temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons that were embedded within physical models that mimic frog body temperatures. Finally, we used our field data to test whether coating iButtons with plastic prevents failure of dataloggers during fieldwork. Although we found statistically significant differences between the temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons, and also between uncoated and coated iButtons embedded in frog models, these effects were relatively small (0–1.3 °C). We also found that coating iButtons with plastic reduced the likelihood of device failure under field conditions (from 8.3% to 0%). We conclude that coating Thermochron iButtons with plastic is an affordable and reliable method of waterproofing dataloggers that prevents device failure and data loss with minimal influence on temperature readings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Roznik","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."}],"citation-key":"roznik2012","container-title":"Journal of Thermal Biology","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.02.004","ISSN":"1879-0992","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7]]},"license":"restricted","page":"260-264","source":"researchonline.jcu.edu.au","title":"Does waterproofing Thermochron iButton dataloggers influence temperature readings?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.02.004","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"rumschlag2018","abstract":"The result of pathogen exposures may depend upon trade-offs in energetic demands for immune responses against host growth and survival. Environmental conditions may influence these trade-offs by affecting host size, or trade-offs may change across seasons, altering impacts of pathogens. We exposed northern leopard frog Lithobates pipiens tadpoles to different larval environments (low leaf litter, high density of conspecifics, atrazine, caged fish, or controls) that influenced size at metamorphosis. Subsequently, we exposed metamorphs to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen, just after metamorphosis and/or prior to overwintering 12 wk later. Bd exposure dramatically reduced survival during overwintering, with the strongest effects when hosts were exposed at both time points. Larval environments resulted in differences in host size. Those exposed to caged fish were 2.5 times larger than the smallest (those exposed to high density of conspecifics), but larval environment did not influence Bd effects on growth and survival. The largest frogs exposed to caged fish had greater survival through overwintering, but in the absence of Bd. We built stage-structured models to evaluate if overwinter mortality from Bd is capable of having effects on host populations. Our models suggest that Bd exposure after metamorphosis or before overwintering can reduce population growth rates. Our study demonstrates that hosts suffer little effects of Bd exposures following metamorphosis and that small body size did not hamper growth and survival. Instead, we provide evidence that winter mortality from Bd exposure is capable of reducing population sizes, providing a plausible mechanism for amphibian declines in temperate regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rumschlag","given":"Samantha L."},{"family":"Boone","given":"Michelle D."}],"citation-key":"rumschlag2018","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao03277","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,16]]},"language":"en","page":"13-28","source":"Crossref","title":"High juvenile mortality in amphibians during overwintering related to fungal pathogen exposure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v131/n1/p13-28/","volume":"131"},

As habitats and climate change due to anthropogenic activities, there is a need to develop species distribution models that can quantify these complex range dynamics. In this paper, we develop a dynamic occupancy model that uses a spatial generalized additive model to estimate non-linear spatial variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates. The model is flexible and can accommodate data from a range of sampling designs that provide information about both occupancy and detection probability. Output from the model can be used to create distribution maps and to estimate indices of temporal range dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by modeling long-term range dynamics of 10 eastern North American birds using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey.

Temperature plays an important role in both pathogen growth and host immune function, but little is known about seasonal dynamics of Bd infection in north temperate regions. Our objective was to increase understanding of Bd disease ecology by investigating patterns of Bd infection of Columbia spotted frogs Rana luteiventris across seasons, age classes, and sexes in north Idaho, USA. We collected skin swabs from 223 R. luteiventris in spring, summer, and fall 2009 at 7 ponds in the Palouse region and quantified Bd zoospores for each sample using quantitative PCR. Across seasons, Bd prevalence of adults was higher in summer than in spring or fall, suggesting that individuals may be clearing low-level infections over the summer. Among age classes, all but one late stage tadpole (Gosner stage 43–45) tested negative for Bd. Conversely, 100% of metamorphs tested positive for Bd and had the highest Bd loads of all age classes, suggesting they may be the most vulnerable age class. Adult R. luteiventris had high infection prevalence (> 60%) in all seasons, indicating that Bd infection is maintained within populations and that adults likely serve as disease reservoirs across seasons. Among adults, we also found weak evidence for females having higher infection prevalence than males. Further laboratory and field studies are needed to determine whether there are individual and population impacts from Bd on R. luteiventris and other amphibians in north Idaho.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Danelle M."},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Caren S."},{"family":"Waits","given":"Lisette P."},{"family":"Rosenblum","given":"Erica Bree"}],"citation-key":"russell2010","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao02286","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,25]]},"language":"en","page":"223-230","source":"Crossref","title":"<i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> infection dynamics in the Columbia spotted frog <i>Rana <span class=\"nocase\">luteiventris</span></i> in north Idaho, USA","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v92/n2-3/p223-230/","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"russell2019","abstract":"Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are becoming more frequent as climate changes wildlife communities at unprecedented rates, driving population declines and raising concerns for species conservation. One critical disease is the global pandemic of chytridiomycosis in frogs, which can be caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Although there is clear evidence for Bd-induced mortality across high-elevation frog communities, little attention is given to the role of lowlands in Bd’s persistence and spread because low elevations are assumed to be too warm to harbor significant levels of Bd. Here, we report widespread Bd infection across 80 frog species from three sites in the lowland Peruvian Amazon, an area with no documented Bd-related amphibian declines. Despite observing no clinical signs of infection in the field, we found that 24–46% of individuals were infected per site (up to �105,000 zoospore equivalents per frog) by three Bd strains from the global pandemic lineage (Bd-GPL). We also found collection site and seasonal effects to be only weak predictors of Bd prevalence and load, with lower elevation and drier habitats marginally decreasing both prevalence and load. We found no further effect of host phylogeny, ecotype, or body size. Our results showing high and widespread prevalence across a lowland tropical ecosystem contradict the expectations based on the global pattern of pathogenicity of Bd that is largely restricted to higher elevations and colder temperatures. These findings imply that the lowlands may play a critical role in the spread and persistence of Bd over time and space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Imani D."},{"family":"Larson","given":"Joanna G."},{"family":"May","given":"Rudolf","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Iris A."},{"family":"James","given":"Timothy Y."},{"family":"Davis Rabosky","given":"Alison R."}],"citation-key":"russell2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0222718","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e0222718","source":"Crossref","title":"Widespread chytrid infection across frogs in the Peruvian Amazon suggests critical role for low elevation in pathogen spread and persistence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222718","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"russell2019a","abstract":"Despite increasing interest in determining the population-level eﬀects of emerging infectious diseases on wildlife, estimating eﬀects of disease on survival rates remains diﬃcult. Even for a well-studied disease such as amphibian chytridiomycosis (caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd]), there are few estimates of how survival of wild hosts is aﬀected. We applied hierarchical models to long-term capture-mark-recapture data (mean = 10.6 yrs, range = 6–15 yrs) from > 5500 uniquely-marked individuals to estimate the eﬀect of Bd on apparent survival of four threatened or endangered ranid frog species (Rana draytonii, R. muscosa, R. pretiosa, R. sierrae) at 14 study sites in California and Oregon (USA) and one bufonid toad (Anaxyrus boreas) at two study sites in Wyoming and Montana. Our models indicated that the presence of Bd on an individual reduced apparent survival of ranid frogs by ~6–15% depending on species and sex. The estimated diﬀerence between toads with and without Bd was 19% for the Montana population and 55% for the Wyoming population; however, the 95% Credible Interval of these estimates included zero. These results provide evidence for negative eﬀects of Bd on survival in wild populations even in the absence of obvious die-oﬀs. Determining what factors inﬂuence the magnitude of the eﬀects of Bd on wildlife populations is an important next step toward identifying management actions. These estimates of Bd eﬀects are important for understanding the extent and severity of disease, whether disease eﬀects have changed over time, and for informing management actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Robin E."},{"family":"Halstead","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Mosher","given":"Brittany A."},{"family":"Muths","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Grant","given":"Evan H.C."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Robert N."},{"family":"Kleeman","given":"Patrick M."},{"family":"Backlin","given":"Adam R."},{"family":"Pearl","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Honeycutt","given":"R.

  {"id":"sapsford2013","abstract":"Infectious diseases can cause population declines and even extinctions. The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused population declines and extinctions in amphibians on most continents. In the tropics, research on the dynamics of this disease has focused on amphibian populations in mountainous areas. In most of these areas, high and low elevation sites are connected by an assemblage of streams that may transport the infectious stage of the pathogen from high to low elevations, and, also, this pathogen, which grows well at cool temperatures, may persist better in cooler water flowing from high elevations. Thus, the dynamics of disease at low elevation sites without aquatic connections to higher elevation sites, i.e., non-contiguous low elevation sites, may differ from dynamics at contiguous low elevation sites. We sampled adult common mistfrogs (Litoria rheocola) at six sites of three types: two at high (> 400m) elevations, two at low elevations contiguous with high elevation streams, and two at low elevations non-contiguous with any high elevation site. Adults were swabbed for Bd diagnosis from June 2010 to June 2011 in each season, over a total of five sampling periods. The prevalence of Bd fluctuated seasonally and was highest in winter across all site types. Site type significantly affected seasonal patterns of prevalence of Bd. Prevalence remained well above zero throughout the year at the high elevation sites. Prevalence declined to lower levels in contiguous low sites, and reached near-zero at non-contiguous low sites. Patterns of air temperature fluctuation were very similar at both the low elevation site types, suggesting that differences in water connectivity to high sites may have affected the seasonal dynamics of Bd prevalence between contiguous and non-contiguous low elevation site types. Our results also suggest that reservoir hosts may be important in the persistence of disease at low elevations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sapsford","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Schwarzkopf","given":"Lin"}],"citation-key":"sapsford2013","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0082425","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,4]]},"language":"en","page":"e82425","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Elevation, temperature, and aquatic connectivity all influence the infection dynamics of the amphibian chytrid fungus in adult frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082425","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"sapsford2018","abstract":"Identifying the factors that affect pathogen prevalence is critical to understanding the effects of wildlife diseases. We aimed to examine drivers of seasonal changes in the prevalence of infection by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in tadpoles. Because tadpoles may be important reservoirs for this disease, examining them will aid in understanding how chytridiomycosis affects entire amphibian populations. We hypothesized that temperature is a strong driver of prevalence of Bd in tadpoles, and the accumulation of infection as tadpoles become larger and older also drives prevalence in this system. We studied Litoria rheocola, a tropical rainforest stream frog with seasonal recruitment of annual tadpoles, and surveyed 6 streams in northeastern Queensland, Australia. Comparisons among models relating infection status to stream type, season, their interaction, tadpole age, and water temperature showed that age explained a large portion of the variance in infection status. Across sites and seasons, larger, older tadpoles had increased mean probabilities of infection, indicating that a large component of the variation among individuals was related to age, and thus to cumulative infection risk. Our results indicate that in systems with annual tadpoles, seasonal changes in infection prevalence may be strongly affected by seasonal patterns of tadpole growth and development in addition to stream type, season, and water temperature. These effects may then influence prevalence of infection in terrestrial individuals in species that have relatively frequent contact with water. This reinforces the need to integrate studies of the drivers of pathogen prevalence across all host life history stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Sapsford","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Schwarzkopf","given":"Lin"}],"citation-key":"sapsford2018","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao03269","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,10]]},"language":"en","page":"83-93","source":"Crossref","title":"Disentangling causes of seasonal infection prevalence patterns: tropical tadpoles and chytridiomycosis as a model system","title-short":"Disentangling causes of seasonal infection prevalence patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v130/n2/p83-93/","volume":"130"},

Multiple formulations of JS models have been developed and include both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Bayesian approaches offer greater flexibility; however, they are often extremely slow when applied to moderate to large populations because the latent states of all observed individuals, as well as any potential unobserved individuals (parameter-expanded data augmentation), must be simulated at each time step.\n              \n              \n                \n                  JS model implementations can be sped up dramatically through marginalization, whereby the conditional likelihoods of states are tracked for unique capture histories, rather than the simulated states of all individuals. Here we describe a marginalized implementation of a multistate JS model and compare its performance to that of an implementation using simulated discrete states.

  {"id":"sasso2021","abstract":"In the last two decades a wealth of field studies has documented Bd infection on amphibians worldwide. These studies have demonstrated that the pathogen presence, infection severity and disease impact differ substantially between and within species. However, aside from the influence of temperature, the relative importance of various biotic and abiotic factors driving pathogen occurrence is unclear, leading to potential bias and limitation in our understanding of host-Bd dynamic ecology. Here, we systematically review the Bd literature that inves­ tigated environmental, pathogen-related or intrinsic species-specific factors to explain spatial patterns of Bd as measured from field-collected samples. We searched Scopus, Web of Science, and key review papers for fieldbased articles published from 1999 to 2020. We evaluated 102 articles on spatial heterogeneity of Bd occur­ rence between amphibian populations. Distinct factors have been investigated to influence either prevalence or infection intensity of Bd, the two most common Bd detection metrics. Factors identified in the studies go beyond temperature-associated constraints on Bd, which is commonly assumed to be the most significant environmental driver. Intra-specific variation in genetic response to the pathogen, presence of invasive species or other taxa, salinity, and even the presence of Bd predators can also underpin the observed pathogen occurrence. We also found that studies were poorly representative of the global geographic distribution of amphibians and focused mostly on Least Concern species and common families. Studies on threatened species are consistently under­ represented within different families. Understanding of Bd-host dynamics as well as conservation management need to be shaped to population and landscape scales to consider the intricacy of factors influencing amphibian declines caused by Bd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Sasso","given":"Thais"},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Hamish"},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"sasso2021","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109300","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"109300","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Occurrence of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> within and between species: A review of influential variables as identified from field studies","title-short":"Occurrence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis within and between species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320721003529","volume":"262"},
  {"id":"sauer2002","abstract":"Many ecological studies require analysis of collections of estimates. For example, population change is routinely estimated for many species from surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and the species are grouped and used in comparative analyses. We developed a hierarchical model for estimation of group attributes from a collection of estimates of population trend. The model uses information from predeﬁned groups of species to provide a context and to supplement data for individual species; summaries of group attributes are improved by statistical methods that simultaneously analyze collections of trend estimates. The model is Bayesian; trends are treated as random variables rather than ﬁxed parameters. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to ﬁt the model. Standard assessments of population stability cannot distinguish magnitude of trend and statistical signiﬁcance of trend estimates, but the hierarchical model allows us to legitimately describe the probability that a trend is within given bounds. Thus we deﬁne population stability in terms of the probability that the magnitude of population change for a species is less than or equal to a predeﬁned threshold. We applied the model to estimates of trend for 399 species from the BBS to estimate the proportion of species with increasing populations and to identify species with unstable populations. Analyses are presented for the collection of all species and for 12 species groups commonly used in BBS summaries. Overall, we estimated that 49% of species in the BBS have positive trends and 33 species have unstable populations. However, the proportion of species with increasing trends differs among habitat groups, with grassland birds having only 19% of species with positive trend estimates and wetland birds having 68% of species with positive trend estimates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauer","given":"John R."},{"family":"Link","given":"William A."}],"citation-key":"sauer2002","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1743:HMOPSA]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1743-1751","source":"Crossref","title":"Hierarchical modeling of population stability and species group attributes from survey data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1743:HMOPSA]2.0.CO;2","volume":"83"},

By measuring thermal preferences, researchers can better understand the effects that temperature tolerances have on ecological and physiological responses to both biotic and abiotic stressors. However, because of funding limitations and confounders, measuring thermoregulation can often be difﬁcult. Here, we provide an effective, affordable ( $ $50 USD per unit), easy to construct, and validated apparatus for measuring the long-term thermal preferences of animals. In tests, the apparatus spanned temperatures from 9.29 to 33.94 °C, and we provide methods to further increase this range. Additionally, we provide simple methods to non-invasively measure animal and substrate temperatures and to prevent temperature preferences of the focal organisms from being confounded with temperature preferences of its prey and its humidity preferences. To validate the apparatus, we show that it was capable of detecting individuallevel consistency and among individual-level variation in the preferred body temperatures of Southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) and Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) over three-weeks. Nearly every aspect of our design is adaptable to meet the needs of a multitude of study systems, including various terrestrial amphibious, and aquatic organisms. The apparatus and methods described here can be used to quantify behavioral thermal preferences, which can be critical for determining temperature tolerances across species and thus the resiliency of species to current and impending climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauer","given":"Erin L."},{"family":"Sperry","given":"Jinelle H."},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."}],"citation-key":"sauer2016","container-title":"Journal of Thermal Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.016","ISSN":"03064565","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8]]},"language":"en","page":"231-236","source":"Crossref","title":"An efficient and inexpensive method for measuring long-term thermoregulatory behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030645651630095X","volume":"60"},

However, some experimental laboratory conditions, such as temperature or infection dose, are regularly chosen based on convenience or convention, and it is unclear how these decisions systematically affect experimental outcomes. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 laboratory studies that exposed amphibians to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to understand better how laboratory temperature, host life stage, infection dose, and host species affect host mortality. We found that host mortality was driven by thermal mismatches: hosts native to cooler environments experienced greater Bd-induced mortality at relatively warm experimental temperatures and vice versa. We also found that Bd dose positively predicted Bd-induced host mortality and that the superfamilies Bufonoidea and Hyloidea were especially susceptible to Bd. Finally, the effect of Bd on host mortality varied across host life stages, with larval amphibians experiencing lower risk of Bd-induced mortality than adults or metamorphs. Metamorphs were especially susceptible and experienced mortality when inoculated with much smaller Bd doses than the average dose used by researchers. Our results suggest that when designing experiments on species interactions, researchers should carefully consider the experimental temperature, inoculum dose, and life stage, and taxonomy of the host species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauer","given":"Erin L."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jeremy M."},{"family":"Lajeunesse","given":"Marc J."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Taegan A."},{"family":"Civitello","given":"David J."},{"family":"Knutie","given":"Sarah A."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Karena"},{"family":"Roznik","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Sears","given":"Brittany F."},{"family":"Bessler","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Delius","given":"Bryan K."},{"family":"Halstead","given":"Neal"},{"family":"Ortega","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Venesky","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Young","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Jason R."}],"citation-key":"sauer2020","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2979","ISSN":"0012-9658, 1939-9170","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4]]},"language":"en","page":"e02979","source":"Crossref","title":"A meta‐analysis reveals temperature, dose, life stage, and taxonomy influence host susceptibility to a fungal parasite","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2979","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"savage2015","abstract":"A central question in evolutionary biology is how interactions between organisms and the environment shape genetic differentiation. The pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused variable population declines in the lowland leopard frog (Lithobates yavapaiensis); thus, disease has potentially shaped, or been shaped by, host genetic diversity. Environmental factors can also inﬂuence both amphibian immunity and Bd virulence, confounding our ability to assess the genetic effects on disease dynamics. Here, we used genetics, pathogen dynamics, and environmental data to characterize L. yavapaiensis populations, estimate migration, and determine relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors in predicting Bd dynamics. We found that the two uninfected populations belonged to a single genetic deme, whereas each infected population was genetically unique. We detected an outlier locus that deviated from neutral expectations and was signiﬁcantly correlated with mortality within populations. Across populations, only environmental variables predicted infection intensity, whereas environment and genetics predicted infection prevalence, and genetic diversity alone predicted mortality. At one locality with geothermally elevated water temperatures, migration estimates revealed source–sink dynamics that have likely prevented local adaptation. We conclude that integrating genetic and environmental variation among populations provides a better understanding of Bd spatial epidemiology, generating more effective conservation management strategies for mitigating amphibian declines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Savage","given":"Anna E."},{"family":"Becker","given":"C.

While chytridiomycosis can cause extinction, many susceptible species persist after an initial period of decline, albeit with reduced abundance and distribution. Emerging evidence indicates that amphibian abundance can recover within remnant populations, but to date, the capacity of amphibian populations to re-expand into historically occupied habitat has received limited research attention. We surveyed 145 sites in 2011 and 2012 to determine if populations of the whistling tree frog (Litoria verreauxii verreauxii) have re-expanded compared with historical data from 1975–1976, 1990 and 1996. L. v. verreauxii underwent a major range contraction likely caused by chytridiomycosis between the ﬁrst two time periods. Populations have recently re-expanded, with 39 new sites colonised despite high prevalence of Bd. We suspect that changes in disease dynamics have resulted in the increased coexistence of L. v. verreauxii and Bd. Habitat attributes at sites that retained frogs for the duration of the study indicate that high quality habitat may contribute to buffering against population level effects of Bd. Colonised sites had more coarse woody debris, suggesting a possible habitat management strategy to encourage range expansion for this species. Given sufﬁcient time and adequate source populations in high quality habitat, it is possible that other amphibian species may re-expand from chytridiomycosis-induced declines. This provides an impetus for the protection of historical, but currently unoccupied amphibian habitats and highlights the importance of maintaining high quality habitat to help species survive novel shocks such as pandemic diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Guarino","given":"Fiorenzo"},{"family":"Osborne","given":"William"},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David A."},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Driscoll","given":"Don A."}],"citation-key":"scheele2014","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2013.12.034","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en","page":"86-91","source":"Crossref","title":"Decline and re-expansion of an amphibian with high prevalence of chytrid fungus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320713004552","volume":"170"},

A striking example of this threat is the emergence of chytridiomycosis. Despite diagnosis of chytridiomycosis as an important driver of global amphibian declines 15 years ago, researchers have yet to devise effective largescale management responses other than biosecurity measures to mitigate disease spread and the establishment of disease-free captive assurance colonies prior to or during disease outbreaks. We examined the development of management actions that can be implemented after an epidemic in surviving populations. We developed a conceptual framework with clear interventions to guide experimental management and applied research so that further extinctions of amphibian species threatened by chytridiomycosis might be prevented. Within our framework, there are 2 management approaches: reducing Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the fungus that causes chytridiomycosis) in the environment or on amphibians and increasing the capacity of populations to persist despite increased mortality from disease. The latter approach emphasizes that mitigation does not necessarily need to focus on reducing disease-associated mortality. We propose promising management actions that can be implemented and tested based on current knowledge and that include habitat manipulation, antifungal treatments, animal translocation, bioaugmentation, head starting, and selection for resistance. Case studies where these strategies are being implemented will demonstrate their potential to save critically endangered species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David A."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Kolby","given":"Jon E."},{"family":"Mcfadden","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Marantelli","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Driscoll","given":"Don A."}],"citation-key":"scheele2014a","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12322","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1195-1205","source":"Crossref","title":"Interventions for reducing extinction risk in chytridiomycosis-threatened amphibians","title-short":"Interventions for Reducing Extinction Risk in Chytridiomycosis-Threatened Amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12322","volume":"28"},

The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, has been documented in over 500 amphibian species globally. Understanding conditions under which amphibians are vulnerable to Bd is important for evaluating species risk and developing surveillance strategies. Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of Bd infection in the ephemeral pond-breeding yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata, a species of high conservation concern in the European Union. We sampled 550 toads from 60 ponds in a traditional agricultural landscape in Southern Transylvania, Romania. Overall, Bd prevalence was low in B. variegata, but infected toads were widely dispersed through the landscape and were found in a quarter of all sampled ephemeral ponds. At the pond level, increased Bd occurrence was associated with short distances to perennial water sources and high forest cover. These ﬁndings suggest that perennial water sources may act as source habitat for Bd, with amphibian movements resulting in Bd spillover into ephemeral ponds. Increased Bd occurrence in ponds surrounded by high levels of forest cover is likely related to cooler and wetter conditions that are more favourable for Bd. Throughout the study landscape, patchy environmental suitability for Bd appears to restrict the pathogen to a subset of B. variegata habitat. Ephemeral ponds in open landscapes, without nearby perennial habitat, likely provide an environmental refuge from Bd, where the risk of infection is low. From a conservation perspective, these ﬁndings highlight the importance of maintaining ephemeral ponds in open landscapes, but these are currently threatened by landuse change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Driscoll","given":"Don A."},{"family":"Fischer","given":"J."},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"A.

Many declined species now only persist in isolated remnant populations. In this study we examine how remnant populations coexist with Bd, focusing on disease impact on adult survival and recruitment potential in the chytridiomycosis-threatened frog Litoria verreauxii alpina. Using skeletochronology we found that the adult male population in both 2011 and 2012 was dominated by a two year old age cohort. The lack of recruitment into the three year old cohort in 2012 indicates that annual adult survival is very low. Combined with high Bd prevalence and heavy infection burdens, the pathogen appears to drive almost complete mortality of breeding adults over their ﬁrst breeding season. However, adults successfully mate prior to large increases in disease prevalence that occurs during the breeding season. Infection prevalence among tadpoles and juveniles is low. Exposure to warm water could provide a mechanism for avoiding or clearing Bd infection. Relatively low Bd prevalence in juveniles prior to dispersal into terrestrial habitat indicates that Bd has minimal impact on early life history stages. As such, recruitment is probably high, allowing populations to persist despite low adult survival. This dependence on reliable annual recruitment may explain why remnant populations persist in permanent ponds rather than ephemeral ponds that were historically occupied. New management strategies that focus on increasing recruitment may provide a way forward for the management of disease-threatened amphibian species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David A."},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Brannelly","given":"Laura A."},{"family":"Driscoll","given":"Don A."}],"citation-key":"scheele2015a","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.032","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"language":"en","page":"36-43","source":"Crossref","title":"Low impact of chytridiomycosis on frog recruitment enables persistence in refuges despite high adult mortality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320714004571","volume":"182"},

  {"id":"scheele2017a","abstract":"Emerging wildlife pathogens are an increasing threat to biodiversity. One of the most serious wildlife diseases is chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has been documented in over 500 amphibian species. Amphibians vary greatly in their susceptibility to Bd; some species tolerate infection, whereas others experience rapid mortality. Reservoir hosts—species that carry infection while maintaining high abundance but are rarely killed by disease—can increase extinction risk in highly susceptible, sympatric species. However, whether reservoir hosts amplify Bd in declining amphibian species has not been examined. We investigated the role of reservoir hosts in the decline of the threatened northern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi) in an amphibian community in southeastern Australia. In the laboratory, we characterized the response of a potential reservoir host, the (nondeclining) common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera), to Bd infection. In the field, we conducted frog abundance surveys and Bd sampling for both P. pengilleyi and C. signifera. We built multinomial logistic regression models to test whether Crinia signifera and environmental factors were associated with P. pengilleyi decline. C. signifera was a reservoir host for Bd. In the laboratory, many individuals maintained intense infections (>1000 zoospore equivalents) over 12 weeks without mortality, and 79% of individuals sampled in the wild also carried infections.

Consistent with disease amplification by a reservoir host, P. pengilleyi declined at sites with high C. signifera abundance.

  {"id":"scheele2017b","abstract":"The impacts of pathogen emergence in naïve hosts can be catastrophic, and pathogen spread now ranks as a major threat to biodiversity. However, pathogen impacts can persist for decades after epidemics and produce variable host outcomes. Chytridiomycosis in amphibians (caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd) is an exemplar, with impacts ranging from rapid population crashes and extinctions, to population declines and subsequent recoveries. Here, we investigate long-term impacts associated with chytridiomycosis in Australia. We conducted a continent-wide assessment of the disease, reviewing data collected since the arrival of Bd in about 1978, to assess and characterize mechanisms driving past, present and future impacts. We found chytridiomycosis to be implicated in the extinction or decline of 43 of Australia's 238 amphibian species. Population trajectories of declined species are highly variable; six species are experiencing ongoing declines, eight species are apparently stable and 11 species are recovering. Our results highlight that while some species are expanding, Bd continues to threaten species long after its emergence. Australian case-studies and synthesis of the global chytridiomycosis literature suggests that amphibian reservoir hosts are associated with continued declines in endemically infected populations, while population stability is promoted by environmental conditions that restrict Bd impact, and maintenance of high recruitment capacity that can offset mortality. Host genetic adaptation or decreased pathogen virulence may facilitate species recovery, but neither has been empirically demonstrated. Understanding processes that inﬂuence Bd-host dynamics and population persistence is crucial for assessing species extinction risk and identifying strategies to conserve disease-threatened species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"scheele2019","abstract":"Globalization has facilitated the emergence and spread of novel pathogens, representing a major conservation challenge. The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, epitomizes this unprecedented threat, being responsible for declines and extinctions of amphibians worldwide. Chytridiomycosis has had both immediate catastrophic impacts during initial epidemics, as well as more variable, ongoing eﬀects as the pathogen transitions to endemicity in its new distribution. Where B. dendrobatidis is now endemic, eﬀective management actions are needed to prevent further extinctions of species. Yet, after nearly 20 years of research, management solutions remain rare or largely untested. Here, we highlight the potential for mitigation strategies focused on the environmental part of the host-pathogen-environment triangle to facilitate coexistence with the pathogen. We provide an extensive literature review to demonstrate that environmental conditions and demographic processes can strongly mediate the impact of B. dendrobatidis, and the capacity of amphibian populations to withstand disease-associated mortality. In particular, novel management approaches to achieve coexistence could focus on manipulating environmental conditions to decrease suitability for B. dendrobatidis and/or increase demographic resilience to disease-associated mortality. Such strategies include translocation to, or creation of, environmental refuges, and habitat manipulation to increase recruitment and oﬀset elevated adult mortality. We argue that responding to chytridiomycosis requires a conceptual readjustment of our baselines to recognize that endemic B. dendrobatidis infection is the ‘new normal’ in surviving populations of many susceptible amphibian species. We conclude with recommendations for research and management actions that can help achieve coexistence of amphibian species susceptible to B. dendrobatidis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Foster","given":"Claire N."},{"family":"Hunter","given":"David A."},{"family":"Lindenmayer","given":"David B."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Benedikt R."},{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey W."}],"citation-key":"scheele2019","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.05.032","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"52-59","source":"Crossref","title":"Living with the enemy: Facilitating amphibian coexistence with disease","title-short":"Living with the enemy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000632071831615X","volume":"236"},

However, traditional methods in conservation generally have limited efficacy in the face of disease threats. Ironically, although unintentional human movement of species has facilitated the spread of pathogens, intentional conservation translocations are a promising approach to combatting disease threats under certain circumstances. Here, we summarize two decades of published literature on translocations of Australian frogs threatened by chytridiomycosis—a fungal disease that has caused amphibian declines and extinctions globally. We identify key motivations, considerations, and factors associated with outcomes, including the role of chytridiomycosis in failures. In an effort to improve success, we then propose a conceptual framework for determining when conservation translocations may be both feasible and beneficial, with a focus on understanding mechanisms favoring host persistence. Lastly, we build on our findings from the review and the conceptual framework to develop a set of recommendations to guide practitioners aiming to translocate amphibians as a conservation strategy in the face of chytridiomycosis. Although diseases pose a unique set of challenges for managing declining species in the wild, we argue that progress is likely with careful and well-informed adaptive management experiments to refine reintroduction and translocation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Hollanders","given":"Matthijs"},{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Emily P."},{"family":"Newell","given":"David A."},{"family":"Lindenmayer","given":"David B."},{"family":"McFadden","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Deon J."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Laura F."}],"citation-key":"scheele2021","container-title":"Conservation Science and Practice","container-title-short":"Conservat Sci and Prac","DOI":"10.1111/csp2.524","ISSN":"2578-4854, 2578-4854","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"254","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conservation translocations for amphibian species threatened by chytrid fungus: A review, conceptual framework, and recommendations","title-short":"Conservation translocations for amphibian species threatened by chytrid fungus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.524","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"scheele2024","abstract":"Understanding factors that influence population-level responses to emerging threats in declining species is crucial for informed conservation action. In amphibian species impacted by the chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), a pathogen that has caused amphibian declines globally, a commonly reported pattern is that more severe population declines tend to occur at higher elevations. Previous research has suggested that this pattern could be driven by reduced environmental suitability for chytrid fungus at lower elevations. However, delayed amphibian maturation, which is common in cold, high elevation populations, could also increase vulnerability to population decline. Here, we tackle this key knowledge gap, focusing on the critically endangered corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree and P. pengilleyi), which have experienced a pattern of extirpation at higher elevations, with remnant populations persisting at lower elevations. First, we quantify the age structure of two extant low elevation P. pengilleyi populations and museum specimens (both species) collected before the emergence of chytrid fungus in Australia. Male age to maturation varied from 1 to 3 years, with the extant population with higher chytrid prevalence displaying severe age structure truncation. Second, we use population simulations to calculate elasticity values under a range of scenarios with varying ages to maturation and chytrid-associated mortality. When the population growth rate was fixed at 1, adult survival became increasingly important as age to maturation increases, particularly under a scenario of high chytrid-associated mortality. Our simulation results indicate that delayed maturation could be a previously underappreciated factor associated with an increased risk of amphibian population decline and that earlier maturation could contribute to population persistence. Our study highlights the importance of examining variation in life history traits to better understand population-level responses to novel threats and guide the development of appropriate conservation actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheele","given":"B.

Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural ﬂuctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images.

To test whether the fungus persists in host populations between episodes of observed host mortality, we quantiﬁed ﬁeld-based Bd infection rates during nonwinter months. We used PCR to sample for the presence of Bd in live individuals from nine seemingly healthy populations of the lowland leopard frog as well as four of the American bullfrog R. catesbeiana (a putative vector for Bd) from Arizona. We found Bd in 10 of 13 sampled populations. The overall prevalence of Bd was 43% in lowland leopard frogs and 18% in American bullfrogs.

This focus neglects important extrinsic determinants of the host/pathogen dynamic, where all barriers to infection should be considered when ascertaining the determinants of infectivity and pathogenicity of wildlife pathogens [1–3]. Those pathogens with free-living stages, such as fungi causing catastrophic wildlife declines on a global scale [4], must confront lengthy exposure to environmental barriers before contact with an uninfected host [5–8]. Hostile environmental conditions therefore have the ability to decrease the density of infectious particles, reducing the force of infection and ameliorating the impact as well as the probability of establishing an infection [9]. Here we show that, in nature, the risk of infection and infectious burden of amphibians infected by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) have a signiﬁcant, site-speciﬁc component, and that these correlate with the microfauna present at a site. Experimental infections show that aquatic microfauna can rapidly lower the abundance and density of infectious stages by consuming Bd zoospores, resulting in a signiﬁcantly reduced probability of infection in anuran tadpoles.

Prescribed fire is reported to have adverse effects on sensitive wetland fauna such as reptiles and amphibians, but surprisingly few empirical data are available to support management recommendations meant to protect herpetofauna from prescribed burning. We examined the effects of prescribed fires one day and one month after burning in eight wetlands across two wetland types in southeastern Michigan using abundance, species richness, and diversity of herpetofauna as metrics. Most amphibian communities returned to pre-burn levels of the three metrics by one month after the burn; reptile communities appeared to be more negatively affected by prescribed fire although sample sizes were extremely low. Response of individual species to burning was more variable; two previously detected amphibians and four previously detected reptiles were not detected by the end of the project, suggesting that some herpetofauna may respond negatively to fire while the most common species are unaffected. Only one individual of the 126 herpetofauna located in this study apparently experienced direct mortality after fire. We noted differences in species richness and diversity between wetland types that were probably attributable to differences in these metrics prior to burning. Although in some cases amphibian communities experienced few or only short-lived negative impacts of fire, we caution that fire effects are likely to be species-specific, such that prescribed burns should always be planned thoughtfully from this perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"V.

Estimation is more difficult because of the convolution of parameters between release and recovery and this convolution may cause estimates of the surviv migration parameters to have low precision. Derived parameters of emigration, immigration, harvest derivation, and overall net survival are also estimated. The models are applied to estimate the migration of Pacific herring among spawning grounds off the west coast of Canada. If animals can be re-released after being recaptured, the model corresponds, in its migration/survival components, to that of Arnason (1972, Researches in Popiulation Ecology 13, 97-113).

A dichotomy exists for conservation-oriented translocations: on one hand, there are those that release plants or animals into known historic ranges and on the other hand, there are releases outside historic distributions. Misuse of or attempts to redeﬁne established terms and a proliferation of variants of new terms such as assisted colonization, confuse and hamper communication. The aim of this opinion article is to describe and deﬁne a conservation translocation spectrum, from species reintroductions to assisted colonization, and beyond, and in so doing provide a standard framework and terminology for discussing translocation options. I suggest that we are moving along this spectrum, away from the dictates of historical species distribution records, toward the inclusion of more risky interventions that will be required to respond to habitat shifts due to anthropogenic impacts. To some extent rapid climate change changes everything, including how we should view introductions versus reintroductions. We need to seriously consider adding other approaches to our conservation toolbox. Assisted colonization will start us along this path, acknowledging as it does the accelerated rate of habitat change and the problems of attempting to preserve dynamic systems. The next step along the conservation translocation spectrum may be for reintroduction biology and restoration ecology to more comprehensively join forces on carefully selected projects to use species introductions to create novel ecosystems through active ecological community construction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Seddon","given":"Philip J."}],"citation-key":"seddon2010","container-title":"Restoration Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00724.x","ISSN":"10612971","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11]]},"language":"en","page":"796-802","source":"Crossref","title":"From reintroduction to assisted colonization: moving along the conservation translocation spectrum","title-short":"From reintroduction to assisted colonization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00724.x","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"senar2004","abstract":"Multi–state analysis of the impacts of avian pox on a population of Serins (Serinus serinus): the importance of estimating recapture rates.— Disease is one of the evolutionary forces shaping populations. Recent studies have shown that epidemics like avian pox, malaria, or mycoplasmosis have affected passerine population dynamics, being responsible for the decline of some populations or disproportionately killing males and larger individuals and thus selecting for specific morphotypes. However, few studies have estimated the effects of an epidemic by following individual birds using the capture–recapture approach. Because avian pox can be diagnosed by direct examination of the birds, we are here able to analyze, using multistate models, the development and consequences of an avian pox epidemic affecting in 1996, a population of Serins (Serinus serinus) in northeastern Spain. The epidemics lasted from June to the end of November of 1996, with a maximum apparent prevalence rate > 30% in October. However, recapture rate of sick birds was very high (0.81, range 0.37–0.93) compared to that of healthy birds (0.21, range 0.02–0.32), which highly inflated apparent prevalence rate. This was additionally supported by the low predicted transition from the state of being uninfected to the state of being infected (0.03, SE 0.03). Once infected, Serin avian pox was very virulent with (15–day) survival rate of infected birds being of only 0.46 (SE 0.17) compared to that of healthy ones (0.87, SE 0.03). Probability of recovery from disease, provided that the bird survived the first two weeks, however, was very high (0.65, SE 0.25). The use of these estimates together with a simple model, allowed us to predict an asymptotic increase to prevalence of about 4% by the end of the outbreak period, followed by a sharp decline, with the only remaining infestations being infected birds that had not yet recovered. This is in contrast to the apparent prevalence of pox and stresses the need to estimate recapture rates when estimating population dynamics parameters.","author":[{"family":"Senar","given":"J.

This information is required to design and implement more effective field surveys and monitoring. We tested the influence of weather and moon phase on capture rates of small mammals in the Murray Mallee region of semi-arid Australia. We used extensive pitfall trapping data collected at 267 sites, totalling 54 492 trap-nights. We built regression models to explore the relationship between the capture rates of five species and daily meteorological conditions, and across families of mammals, including dasyurids, burramyids and rodents. A relationship common to several taxa was the positive influence of high winds (.20 km hÀ1) on capture rates. We also identified differences between taxa, with warmer overnight temperatures increasing capture rates of mallee ningaui but decreasing those of Bolam’s mouse. This makes it difficult to determine a single set of ‘optimal’ meteorological conditions for surveying the entire community but points to conditions favourable to individual species and groups. We recommend that surveys undertaken in warmer months encompass a variety of meteorological conditions to increase capture rates and provide a representative sample of the small mammal community present in a landscape.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Senior","given":"Katharine L."},{"family":"Ramsauer","given":"Julia"},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Luke T."}],"citation-key":"senior2020","container-title":"Australian Mammalogy","DOI":"10.1071/AM19056","ISSN":"0310-0049","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"The influence of weather and moon phase on small mammal activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=AM19056"},

Using time as a measure of effort, we compared visual encounter surveys with artificial cover objects (strapped to trees), targeting an arboreal elapid, the pale-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bitorquatus) and its potential prey (geckos). Within a red gum forest vegetation community with relatively high snake density, capture rates were 0.6 ± 0.1 (s.e.) snakes/person-hour using visual encounter surveys, compared with only 0.1 ± 0.1 snakes/person-hour using cover objects. The probability of detection of pale-headed snakes was estimated from occupancy modelling at 0.70 ± 0.06 in visual encounter surveys and 0.19 ± 0.09 in cover object surveys. Gecko capture rates (among all vegetation communities) were significantly greater (P < 0.001) using cover objects. The probability of detection of geckos was estimated from occupancy modelling at 0.77 ± 0.05 in visual encounter surveys and 0.97 ± 0.02 in cover object surveys. Geckos favoured (P < 0.001) cover objects facing south during all seasons except winter.

Here, we examine tadpole ecomorphological guilds at a macroevolutionary scale by examining morphological diversity across the Australian continent. We use ecological data to classify species to guilds, and geometric morphometrics to quantify body shape in the tadpoles of 188 species, 77% of Australian frog diversity. We find that the ecomorphological guilds represented by Australian species are morphologically distinct, but there is substantial morphological variation associated with each guild, and all guilds together form a morphological continuum. However, in a phylogenetic comparative context, there is no significant difference in body shape among guilds. We also relate the morphological diversity of the Australian assemblage of tadpoles to a global sample and demonstrate that ecomorphological diversity of Australian tadpoles is limited with respect to worldwide species. Our results demonstrate that general patterns of ecomorphological variation are upheld in Australian tadpoles, but tadpole body shape is more variable and possibly generalist than generally appreciated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Sherratt","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Anstis","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Keogh","given":"J.

  {"id":"shin2014","abstract":"The pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (denoted Bd), causes large-scale epizootics in na¨ıve amphibian populations. Intervention strategies to rapidly respond to Bd incursions require sensitive and accurate diagnostic methods. Chytridiomycosis usually is assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) amplification of amphibian skin swabs. Results based on this method, however, sometimes yield inconsistent results on infection status and inaccurate scores of infection intensity. In Asia and other regions where amphibians typically bear low Bd loads, swab results are least reliable. We developed a Bd-sampling method that collects zoospores released by infected subjects into an aquatic medium. Bd DNA is extracted by filters and amplified by nested PCR. Using laboratory colonies and field populations of Bombina orientalis, we compare results with those obtained on the same subjects by qPCR of DNA extracted from swabs. Many subjects, despite being diagnosed as Bd-negative by conventional methods, released Bd zoospores into collection containers and thus must be considered infected. Infection loads determined from filtered water were at least 1000 times higher than those estimated from swabs. Subjects significantly varied in infection load, as they intermittently released zoospores, over a 5-day period. Thus, the method might be used to compare the infectivity of individuals and study the periodicity of zoospore release. Sampling methods based on water filtration can dramatically increase the capacity to accurately diagnose chytridiomycosis and contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between Bd and its hosts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Shin","given":"Jaehyub"},{"family":"Bataille","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Kosch","given":"Tiffany A."},{"family":"Waldman","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"shin2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0111091","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e111091","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Swabbing often fails to detect amphibian chytridiomycosis under conditions of low infection load","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111091","volume":"9"},

Both in the field and in captivity, T. carinatus is more arboreal than any other Australian elapid except for the genus Hoplocephalus. Many similarities between Tropidechis and Notechis (tigersnakes) suggest a close phylogenetic relationship between these two genera.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Shine","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Charles","given":"Neil"}],"citation-key":"shine1982","container-title":"Journal of Herpetology","DOI":"10.2307/1563568","ISSN":"00221511","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",12]]},"language":"en","page":"383-387","source":"Crossref","title":"Ecology of the Australian elapid snake <i>Tropidechis carinatus</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1563568?origin=crossref","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"shine1983","abstract":"The taipan, Oxyuranus scutellatus, is a large slender elapid of coastal tropical Australia. The small-scaled snake, O. microlepidotus, is a similar snake from the arid zone. These are among the most highly venomous snakes in Australia, and probably in the world. We present information on body sizes, sexual size dimorphism, feeding habits, reproductive cycles, fecundity and inferred growth rates, based on dissection of museum specimens and observation of captive snakes. Adult snakes average approximately 1.5 m SVL in both Oxyuranus species, and males and females attain similar body sizes. Oxyuranus species are unique among Australian elapids in feeding exclusively upon endothermic prey. A wide variety of marsupials and rodents is taken: especially Rattus villosissimus and Antechinomys laniger by O. microlepidotus, and Melomys sp., Mus musculus, Perameles nasuta and Rattus spp. by O. scutellatus. The large body size, highly toxic venom and \"snap and release\" bite of Oxyuranus species may be adaptations to feeding on mammalian prey. Over recent decades, taipans have become more common relative to other large elapid species: we suggest that this may be due to the introduction of the toxic cane toad (Bufo marinus) as well as habitat modification by agriculture. Both Oxyuranus species are oviparous, with mating and oviposition from August to December. Fecundity (7-20 eggs), incubation period (60-80 days), and size at hatching (300-340 mm SVL) are similar in both species. Captive taipans show rapid growth, with sexual maturation as early as 16 months of age in males, and 28 months in females. In several aspects of morphology, ecology and behavior, O. scutellatus is strongly convergent with an African elapid, Dendroaspis polylepis (the black mamba).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Shine","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Covacevich","given":"Jeanette"}],"citation-key":"shine1983","container-title":"Journal of Herpetology","DOI":"10.2307/1563782","ISSN":"0022-1511","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"page":"60-69","publisher":"Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles","source":"JSTOR","title":"Ecology of highly venomous snakes: The Australian genus <i>Oxyuranus</i> (Elapidae)","title-short":"Ecology of highly venomous snakes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1563782","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"shine2004","abstract":"The causes, magnitude and phenotypic determinants of mortality are central features of population demography. Although critical to effective conservation planning, these attributes remain poorly understood for most wild vertebrates. Exceptionally dense aggregations of garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) in and around communal overwintering dens in central Manitoba provide an exceptional opportunity to enumerate these factors. Over the course of long-term field studies we obtained data on mortality of snakes in autumn as they migrated back from their summer ranges, and in winter during and after their entry into the underground dens. Some mortality sources were affected by a snake's phenotype: for example, snakes killed by motor vehicles were smaller, on average, than surviving snakes. However, two major episodes of mortality at the dens themselves (freezing during midwinter due to atypically light snow cover; and drowning due to flooding after heavy rains late in autumn) were essentially random with respect to phenotype. Mark–recapture estimates suggest that the winterkill event eliminated >60,000 snakes, comprising almost the entire populations of the three largest dens. Although such events are cryptic because the bodies of frozen animals remain underground, they are of much greater magnitude than overt mortality sources for active snakes (roadkills, predation, etc.). Thus, relatively minor habitat manipulations around the dens may contribute more to conservation of these populations than would extensive efforts to protect active snakes during their spring and autumn migrations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Shine","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Robert T"}],"citation-key":"shine2004","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2004.02.014","ISSN":"0006-3207","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11,1]]},"page":"201-210","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Patterns of mortality in a cold-climate population of garter snakes (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis</i>)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704000722","volume":"120"},
  {"id":"sievers2018","abstract":"Abstract Around cities, natural wetlands are rapidly being destroyed and replaced with wetlands constructed to treat stormwater. Although the intended purpose of these wetlands is to manage urban stormwater, they are inhabited by wildlife that might be exposed to contaminants. These effects will be exacerbated if animals are unable to differentiate between stormwater treatment wetlands of varying quality and some function as ?ecological traps? (i.e., habitats that animals prefer despite fitness being lower than in other habitats). To examine if urban stormwater wetlands can be ecological traps for frogs, we tested if survival, metamorphosis-related measures, and predator avoidance behaviors of frogs differed within mesocosms that simulated stormwater wetlands with different contaminant levels, and paired this with a natural oviposition experiment to assess breeding-site preferences. We provide the first empirical evidence that these wetlands can function as ecological traps for frogs. Tadpoles had lower survival and were less responsive to predator olfactory cues when raised in more polluted stormwater wetlands, but also reached metamorphosis earlier and at a larger size. A greater size at metamorphosis was likely a result of increased per capita food availability due to higher mortality combined with eutrophication, although other compensatory effects such as selective-mortality removing smaller individuals from low-quality mesocosms may also explain these results. Breeding adults laid comparable numbers of eggs across wetlands with high and low contaminant levels, indicating no avoidance of the former. Since stormwater treatment wetlands are often the only available aquatic habitat in urban landscapes we need to better understand how they perform as habitats to guide management decisions that mitigate their potential ecological costs. This may include improving wetland quality so that fitness is no longer compromised, preventing colonization by animals, altering the cues animals use when selecting habitats, pretreating contaminated water prior to release, providing off-line wetlands nearby, or simply not constructing stormwater treatment wetlands in sensitive areas. Our study confirms the potential for urban stormwater treatment wetlands to function as ecological traps and highlights the need for greater awareness of their prevalence and impact at landscape scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sievers","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Parris","given":"Kirsten M."},{"family":"Swearer","given":"Stephen E."},{"family":"Hale","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"sievers2018","container-title":"Ecological Applications","container-title-short":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1714","ISSN":"1051-0761","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"page":"1106-1115","source":"esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au (Atypon)","title":"Stormwater wetlands can function as ecological traps for urban frogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au/doi/full/10.1002/eap.1714","volume":"28"},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which deﬁnes the model component to be a ﬂexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are deﬁned to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-deﬁned scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to deﬁne default prior distributions.

Using historical information and recent data from a river, we aimed to investigate and disentangle these effects and evaluate the differences in structural and functional responses of natives and alien invasives to the same predictors. Variation partitioning showed that alien species were as important predictors as were environmental factors and time in explaining species composition of native freshwater mollusk communities. Aliens were more independent of environmental conditions than natives and responded to different drivers, partially explaining their invasion success. The increased abundance of some alien gastropods was positively related to taxonomic diversity, while certain alien bivalves were negatively associated with the functional diversity of native communities.

This information is crucial to implementing appropriate quarantine strategies, preparing for outbreaks of chytridiomycosis due to introduction of Bd, and for directing conservation actions towards affected species. This survey protocol provides a simple and standard method for sampling all frog populations in Australia to maximise the chances of detecting Bd. In order to structure and prioritise the protocol, areas are divided by bioregion and frog species are allocated depending on the water bodies they utilize into 3 groups representing different levels of risk of exposure to Bd. Sixty individuals per population need to be tested to achieve 95% certainty of detecting 1 positive frog, based on the minimum apparent prevalence of ≥5% in infected Australian frog populations and using a quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR test. The appropriate season to sample varies among bioregions and will ideally incorporate temperatures favourable for chytridiomycosis (e.g. maximum air temperatures generally < 27°C). Opportunistic collection and testing of sick frogs and tadpoles with abnormal mouthparts should also be done to increase the probability of detecting Bd. The survey priorities in order are (1) threatened species that may have been exposed to Bd, (2) bioregions surrounding infected bioregions/ecological groups, and (3) species of frogs of unknown infection status in infected bioregions. Within these priority groups, sampling should first target ecological groups and species likely to be exposed to Bd, such as those associated with permanent water, and areas within bioregions that have high risk for Bd as indicated by climatic modelling.

Bd was easily detected in known infected areas, such as the Wet Tropics and South East Queensland. It was not detected in bioregions adjacent to, but inland from or to the north of, infected regions: Einasleigh Uplands and Cape York adjacent to the infected Wet Tropics; and Brigalow Belt South adjacent to the infected South East Queensland bioregion. These regions where Bd was not detected have bordered infected regions for between 15 yr (in northern Queensland) and 30 yr (in southern Queensland), and so they define the geographical limits of Bd with regard to the long-term environmental conditions in Queensland. The Gulf Plains, a bioregion distant from infected bioregions, was also negative. Bd was confined to rainforest and bordering habitats, such as wet eucalypt forests. Infections were largely confined to permanent water-associated species, consistent with this being an important cause of this group having the greatest declines. Our data supports biogeographic climatic models that show much of inland and northern Australia to be too hot and dry to support Bd. As there is limited opportunity for Bd to spread further in Queensland, the priority for management is reducing the impact of Bd in affected populations and assisting frogs to disperse into their former distributions.

We compared histological samples with a Taqman real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) test in five species of frogs at different times of the year at six locations in the wet tropics of northern Queensland. The sensitivity and specificity of each test were estimated using prior estimates from previous laboratory studies and Bayesian methods. The qPCR test was almost three times as sensitive 72.9% (62.7–82.2%) than histology 26.5% (19.9–33.9%) but was less specific 94.2% (89.3–98.6%) than histology 99.5% (98.4–100%), which was likely caused by contamination. Monitoring of the negative control success rate of the qPCR test is potentially a good indicator of specificity. It is likely that using individual gloves for handling amphibians reduces cross-contamination and, therefore, improves specificity rather than cause inhibition of the qPCR. Classifying indeterminate results as positive will increase the qPCR test sensitivity but will lower specificity to a lesser degree depending on the likelihood of contamination. Although PCR is the preferred test for amphibian populations, histology is useful when wishing to confirm a diagnosis of infection and in situations where observing the severity of infection and pathology in skin is desired.

  {"id":"skerratt2016","abstract":"To protect Australian amphibian biodiversity, we have identiﬁed and prioritised frog species at an imminent risk of extinction from chytridiomycosis, and devised national management and research priorities for disease mitigation. Six Australian frogs have not been observed in the wild since the initial emergence of chytridiomycosis and may be extinct. Seven extant frog species were assessed as needing urgent conservation interventions because of (1) their small populations and/or ongoing declines throughout their ranges (southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree, New South Wales), northern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi, Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales), Baw Baw frog (Philoria frosti, Victoria), Litoria spenceri (spotted tree frog, Victoria, New South Wales), Kroombit tinkerfrog (Taudactylus pleione, Queensland), armoured mist frog (Litoria lorica, Queensland)) or (2) predicted severe decline associated with the spread of chytridiomycosis in the case of Tasmanian tree frog (Litoria burrowsae, Tasmania). For these species, the risk of extinction is high, but can be mitigated. They require increased survey effort to deﬁne their distributional limits and to monitor and detect further population changes, as well as well-resourced management strategies that include captive assurance populations. A further 22 frog species were considered at a moderate to lower risk of extinction from chytridiomycosis. Management actions that identify and create or maintain habitat refugia from chytridiomycosis and target other threatening processes such as habitat loss and degradation may be effective in promoting their recovery. Our assessments for some of these species remain uncertain and further taxonomical clariﬁcation is needed to determine their conservation importance. Management actions are currently being developed and trialled to mitigate the threat posed by chytridiomycosis. However, proven solutions to facilitate population recovery in the wild are lacking; hence, we prioritise research topics to achieve this aim. Importantly, the effectiveness of novel management solutions will likely differ among species due to variation in disease ecology, highlighting the need for species-speciﬁc research. We call for an independent management and research fund of AU$15 million over 5 years to be allocated to recovery actions as determined by a National Chytridiomycosis Working Group of amphibian managers and scientists.

  {"id":"soberon2009","abstract":"Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of “niche” that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Soberón","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"soberon2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"solin2020","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of $$\\mathbb {R}^d$$. On this approximate eigenbasis, the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as $$\\mathcal {O}(nm^2)$$ (initial) and $$\\mathcal {O}(m^3)$$ (hyperparameter learning) with m basis functions and n data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by $${\\sim }1/m$$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Solin","given":"Arno"},{"family":"Särkkä","given":"Simo"}],"citation-key":"solin2020","container-title":"Statistics and Computing","container-title-short":"Stat Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s11222-019-09886-w","ISSN":"1573-1375","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"419-446","source":"Springer Link","title":"Hilbert space methods for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-019-09886-w","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"song2019","abstract":"We present an overlooked but important property of modern coexistence theory (MCT), along with two key new results and their consequences. The overlooked property is that stabilizing mechanisms (increasing species’ niche differences) and equalizing mechanisms (reducing species’ ﬁtness differences) have two distinct sets of meanings within MCT: one in a two-species context and another in a general multispecies context. We demonstrate that the two-species framework is not a special case of the multispecies one, and therefore these two parallel frameworks must be studied independently. Our ﬁrst result is that, using the two-species framework and mechanistic consumer-resource models, stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms exhibit complex interdependence, such that changing one will simultaneously change the other. Furthermore, the nature and direction of this simultaneous change sensitively depend on model parameters. The second result states that while MCT is often seen as bridging niche and neutral modes of coexistence by building a niche-neutrality continuum, the interdependence between stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms acts to break this continuum under almost any biologically relevant circumstance. We conclude that the complex entanglement of stabilizing and equalizing terms makes their impact on coexistence difﬁcult to understand, but by seeing them as aggregated effects (rather than underlying causes) of coexistence, we may increase our understanding of ecological dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Chuliang"},{"family":"Barabás","given":"György"},{"family":"Saavedra","given":"Serguei"}],"citation-key":"song2019","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/705347","ISSN":"0003-0147, 1537-5323","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"language":"en","page":"627-639","source":"Crossref","title":"On the consequences of the interdependence of stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/705347","volume":"194"},

We consider ﬁtting of log-Gaussian Cox processes to spatial point patterns relative to spatial covariate data. From an ecological point of view, an important aim of the analysis is to assess signiﬁcant associations between the covariates and the point pattern intensity of a given species. This paper introduces the use of a reparameterised model to facilitate meaningful interpretations of the results and how these depend on hyperprior speciﬁcations. The model combines a scaled spatially structured ﬁeld with an unstructured random ﬁeld, having a common precision parameter. An additional hyperparameter identiﬁes the fraction of variance explained by the spatially structured term and proper scaling makes the analysis invariant to grid resolution. The hyperparameters are assigned penalised complexity priors, which can be tuned intuitively by user-deﬁned scaling parameters.

  {"id":"spake2023","abstract":"Ecologists routinely use statistical models to detect and explain interactions among ecological drivers, with a goal to evaluate whether an effect of interest changes in sign or magnitude in different contexts. Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale – whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry – whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modification (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentification of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Spake","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Bowler","given":"Diana E."},{"family":"Callaghan","given":"Corey T."},{"family":"Blowes","given":"Shane A."},{"family":"Doncaster","given":"C.

  {"id":"steen2021","abstract":"Spatial biases are a common feature of presence–absence data from citizen scientists. Spatial thinning can mitigate errors in species distribution models (SDMs) that use these data. When detections or non-detections are rare, however, SDMs may suffer from class imbalance or low sample size of the minority (i.e. rarer) class. Poor predictions can result, the severity of which may vary by modelling technique. To explore the consequences of spatial bias and class imbalance in presence–absence data, we used eBird citizen science data for 102 bird species from the northeastern USA to compare spatial thinning, class balancing and majority-only thinning (i.e. retaining all samples of the minority class). We created SDMs using two parametric or semi-parametric techniques (generalized linear models and generalized additive models) and two machine learning techniques (random forest and boosted regression trees). We tested the predictive abilities of these SDMs using an independent and systematically collected reference dataset with a combination of discrimination (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; true skill statistic; area under the precision-recall curve) and calibration (Brier score; Cohen's kappa) metrics. We found large variation in SDM performance depending on thinning and balancing decisions. Across all species, there was no single best approach, with the optimal choice of thinning and/or balancing depending on modelling technique, performance metric and the baseline sample prevalence of species in the data. Spatially thinning all the data was often a poor approach, especially for species with baseline sample prevalence <0.1. For most of these rare species, balancing classes improved model discrimination between presence and absence classes using machine learning techniques, but typically hindered model calibration. Baseline sample prevalence, sample size, modelling approach and the intended application of SDM output—whether discrimination or calibration—should guide decisions about how to thin or balance data, given the considerable influence of these methodological choices on SDM performance. For prognostic applications requiring good model calibration (vis-à-vis discrimination), the match between sample prevalence and true species prevalence may be the overriding feature and warrants further investigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Steen","given":"Valerie A."},{"family":"Tingley","given":"Morgan W."},{"family":"Paton","given":"Peter W.

An understanding of these relationships is important for understanding disease ecology and developing mitigation strategies. Widespread emergence of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has had devastating effects on amphibian populations. The causative pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is sensitive to temperature, but its thermal tolerances are not well studied. We examined the thermal responses of three Bd isolates collected across a latitudinal gradient in eastern Australia. Temperature affected all aspects of Bd growth and reproduction that we measured, in ways that often differed among Bd isolates. Aspects of growth, reproduction, and their relationships to temperature that differed among isolates included upper thermal maxima for growth (26, 27, or 28°C, depending on the isolate), relationships between zoospore production and temperature, and zoospore activity and temperature. Two isolates decreased zoospore production as temperature increased, whereas the third isolate was less fecund overall, but did not show a strong response to temperature until reaching the upper limit of its thermal tolerance. Our results show differentiation in life-history traits among isolates within Australia, suggesting that the pathogen may exhibit local adaptation. An understanding of how environmental temperatures can limit pathogens by constraining fitness will enhance our ability to assess pathogen dynamics in the field, model pathogen spread, and conduct realistic experiments on host susceptibility and disease transmission.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Lisa A."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Bell","given":"Sara C."},{"family":"Roznik","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Pike","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"stevenson2013","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0073830","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,4]]},"language":"en","page":"e73830","source":"Crossref","title":"Variation in thermal performance of a widespread pathogen, the amphibian chytrid fungus <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073830","volume":"8"},

Determining whether the thermal behaviors of individual species inﬂuence susceptibility to disease can help enhance our ability to explain and predict how and when disease outbreaks are likely to occur. The widespread disease chytridiomycosis (caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd) often has species-speciﬁc impacts on amphibian communities; some host species are asymptomatic, whereas others experience mass mortalities and population extirpation. We determined whether the average natural thermal regimes experienced by sympatric frog species in nature, in and of themselves, can account for differences in vulnerability to disease. We did this by growing Bd under temperatures mimicking those experienced by frogs in the wild. At low and high elevations, the rainforest frogs Litoria nannotis, L. rheocola, and L. serrata maintained mean thermal regimes within the optimal range for pathogen growth (15–25°C). Thermal regimes for L. serrata, which has recovered from Bd-related declines, resulted in slower pathogen growth than the cooler and less variable thermal regimes for the other two species, which have experienced more long-lasting declines. For L. rheocola and L. serrata, pathogen growth was faster in thermal regimes corresponding to high elevations than in those corresponding to low elevations, where temperatures were warmer. For L. nannotis, which prefers moist and thermally stable microenvironments, pathogen growth was fastest for low-elevation thermal regimes. All of the thermal regimes we tested resulted in pathogen growth rates equivalent to, or signiﬁcantly faster than, rates expected from constant-temperature experiments. The effects of host body temperature on Bd can explain many of the broad ecological patterns of population declines in our focal species, via direct effects on pathogen ﬁtness. Understanding the functional response of pathogens to conditions experienced by the host is important for determining the ecological drivers of disease outbreaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Lisa A."},{"family":"Roznik","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Pike","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"stevenson2014","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.1271","ISSN":"20457758","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"language":"en","page":"4053-4064","source":"Crossref","title":"Host-specific thermal profiles affect fitness of a widespread pathogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.1271","volume":"4"},

In this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam’s dissertation. In the process Fisher’s unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the consistency and eﬃciency of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher’s derivation of the information inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler’s Relation for homogeneous functions.

  {"id":"stockwell2008","abstract":"Reintroduction programs are used widely in conservation to reduce a species’ risk of extinction and amphibians are considered suitable candidates for such programs because of their behavioural simplicity and high reproductive output.The Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea is an endangered species that has been reintroduced into several areas within its natural range, but the outcome of these programs remain unknown.This paper presents the results from the first release of the bell frog in the Hunter Region of New South Wales. This reintroduction released 850 tadpoles into a closed system of three ponds and rehabilitated habitat.Tadpole survival was high but following metamorphosis a decline in numbers began that continued for 13 months and resulted in the disappearance of all released bell frogs.The cause of this decline was investigated and eventually attributed to infection by the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.These results emphasize the importance of including regular chytrid testing in the monitoring of both natural populations and reintroduction programs, particularly as few sick and dead animals were found to indicate its presence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Clulow","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Clulow","given":"John"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"stockwell2008","container-title":"Australian Zoologist","DOI":"10.7882/AZ.2008.015","ISSN":"0067-2238","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10]]},"language":"en","page":"379-386","source":"Crossref","title":"The impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> on a green and golden bell frog <i>Litoria aurea</i> reintroduction program at the Hunter Wetlands Centre Australia in the Hunter Region of NSW","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://publications.rzsnsw.org.au/doi/10.7882/AZ.2008.015","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"stockwell2010","abstract":"Introduced pathogens are increasingly being implicated in population declines and their effects are difﬁcult to manage. In the absence of methods to eradicate pathogens acting as threatening processes, intervention before population decline is necessary. Such an intervention requires an ability to predict when population declines will occur, and therefore, an understanding of when exposure will lead to infection, disease, death and population decline. This study investigates when pathogen exposure leads to disease for the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has been implicated as a causal agent in the global amphibian decline. Susceptibility studies were conducted on two anuran species, the green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea and the striped marsh frog Limnodynastes peronii, when exposed to the fungus as either tadpoles or juveniles. Host species was found to signiﬁcantly affect the outcome of exposure, with infection loads in L. aurea increasing over time and resulting in signiﬁcantly lower survival rates than unexposed. By comparison, infection loads in L. peronii remained the same or decreased over time following the initial infection, and survival rates were no different whether exposed to B. dendrobatidis or not. These outcomes were independent of the life stage at exposure. Individuals with higher infection loads were not found to have lower survival rates; rather, an infection load threshold was identiﬁed where individuals with infection loads that crossed this threshold had high likelihoods of showing terminal signs of chytridiomycosis. Therefore, host species determined whether infection load crossed this threshold and the crossing of the threshold determined the incidence of disease and survival. The quantiﬁcation of infection load thresholds for survival, along with the time it takes to reach them, will enable infection loads in wild populations to be related to the likelihood of disease and is the ﬁrst step in the understanding and prediction of when exposure will result in population decline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Michelle P."},{"family":"Clulow, John","given":"J."},{"family":"Mahony","given":"M.

  {"id":"stockwell2015b","abstract":"The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been implicated in the decline and extinction of amphibian populations worldwide, but management options are limited. Recent studies show that sodium chloride (NaCl) has fungicidal properties that reduce the mortality rates of infected hosts in captivity. We investigated whether similar results can be obtained by adding salt to water bodies in the field. We increased the salinity of 8 water bodies to 2 or 4 ppt and left an additional 4 water bodies with close to 0 ppt and monitored salinity for 18 months. Captively bred tadpoles of green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) were released into each water body and their development, levels of B. dendrobatidis infection, and survival were monitored at 1, 4, and 12 months. The effect of salt on the abundance of nontarget organisms was also investigated in before and after style analyses. Salinities remained constant over time with little intervention. Hosts in water bodies with 4 ppt salt had a significantly lower prevalence of chytrid infection and higher survival, following metamorphosis, than hosts in 0 ppt salt. Tadpoles in the 4 ppt group were smaller in length after 1 month in the release site than those in the 0 and 2 ppt groups, but after metamorphosis body size in all water bodies was similar . In water bodies with 4 ppt salt, the abundance of dwarf tree frogs (Litoria fallax), dragonfly larvae, and damselfly larvae was lower than in water bodies with 0 and 2 ppt salt, which could have knock-on effects for community structure. Based on our results, salt may be an effective field-based B. dendrobatidis mitigation tool for lentic amphibians that could contribute to the conservation of numerous susceptible species. However, as in all conservation efforts, these benefits need to be weighed against negative effects on both target and nontarget organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Michelle P."},{"family":"Storrie","given":"Lachlan J."},{"family":"Pollard","given":"Carla J."},{"family":"Clulow","given":"John"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"stockwell2015b","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12402","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4]]},"language":"en","page":"391-399","source":"Crossref","title":"Effects of pond salinization on survival rate of amphibian hosts infected with the chytrid fungus","title-short":"Effects of pond salinization on survival rate of amphibian hosts infected with the chytrid fungus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12402","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"stockwell2016","abstract":"A simple diagnosis of the presence or absence of an infection is an uninformative metric when individuals differ considerably in their tolerance to different infection loads or resistance to rates of disease progression. Models that incorporate the relationship between the progression of the infection with the potential alternate outcomes provide a far more powerful predictive tool than diagnosis alone. The global decline of amphibians has been amplified by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a pathogen that can cause the fatal disease chytridiomycosis. We measured the infection load and observed signs of disease in Litoria aurea. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to quantify the dissimilarity between the infection loads of L. aurea that showed signs associated with chytridiomycosis and those that did not. Litoria aurea had a 78% probability of developing chytridiomycosis past a threshold of 68 zoospore equivalents (ZE) per swab and chytridiomycosis occurred within a variable range of 0.5–490 ZE. Studies should incorporate a species-specific threshold as a predictor of chytridiomycosis, rather than a binary diagnosis. Measures of susceptibility to chytridiomycosis must account not only for the ability of B. dendrobatidis to increase its abundance on the skin of amphibians but also to determine how each species tolerates these infection loads.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Stockwell","given":"Michelle P."},{"family":"Garnham","given":"James I."},{"family":"Bower","given":"Deborah S."},{"family":"Clulow","given":"John"},{"family":"Mahony","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"stockwell2016","container-title":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","DOI":"10.1093/femsle/fnw111","editor":[{"family":"Boden","given":"Rich"}],"ISSN":"1574-6968","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"en","page":"fnw111","source":"Crossref","title":"Low disease-causing threshold in a frog species susceptible to chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/femsle/fnw111","volume":"363"},

Males of M. fleayi formed dense chorusing aggregations in shallow stony riffles of their rainforest stream.The number of individuals comprising the chorus was highly variable and related significantly to ambient temperature and stream height which, with rainfall, humidity and wind intensity accounted for 96.9% of the variation. Male M. fasciolatus did not show similar aggregation and called from more dispersed locations. The number of M. fasciolatus sighted on any given night showed no correlation with any of the assessed environmental variables. Mixophyes fleayi appeared to have particular and specialised environmental and habitat requirements for breeding whereas M. fasciolatus appeared to be more of a generalist in its reproductive requirements.

  {"id":"summer2022","abstract":"Bacteria in biofilm formations are up to 1000 times less susceptible to antibiotics than their planktonic coun­ terparts. Recognition of the role of biofilms in ~80% of chronic infections, their contribution to bacterial tolerance and development of antimicrobial resistance, and thus the search for compounds with antibiofilm properties, has increased greatly in recent years. The need for robust experimental methods is therefore critical but currently undermined by inappropriate controls when dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) is used to enhance test compound solubility. DMSO is known to have a limited effect on planktonic growth, but emerging data indicates that the solvent can affect biofilm formation even at low concentrations. Here, we present both a literature review on the application of DMSO in in vitro antibiofilm studies, as well as a series of experiments and Bayesian hormetic dose-response modelling to define the effects of DMSO alone and in combination with standard anti­ biotics using two clinically important biofilm-forming bacteria. DMSO has been used in 76 published studies to solubilise a wide variety of synthesised and natural products, including plant extracts, isolated secondary me­ tabolites, modified lead molecules and proteins, in in vitro antibiofilm assays. DMSO solvent concentrations to which biofilms were exposed ranged between <1 and 100% but unfortunately, 35% of articles did not specify the DMSO concentrations used, 50% of articles did not include solvent controls and, of those that did, 26% did not specify control concentrations, 47% did not report or discuss control data, and 53% omitted media controls. In a further 12 studies, DMSO is used as a biofilm treatment, demonstrating the antibiofilm properties of this solvent at higher concentrations. We provide evidence that DMSO (between 0.03 and 25%) significantly inhibits biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not Streptococcus pneumoniae, and acts synergistically with standard antibiotics at very low concentrations (<1%). Interestingly, intermediate concentrations of DMSO (~6%) strongly promote the growth of P. aeruginosa biofilms. As the research community strives to identify bioactive antimicrobial compounds, there is a need for increased scientific rigour when using DMSO as a solvent in antibiofilm assays.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Summer","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Browne","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Hollanders","given":"Matthijs"},{"family":"Benkendorff","given":"Kirsten"}],"citation-key":"summer2022","container-title":"Biofilm","container-title-short":"Biofilm","DOI":"10.1016/j.bioflm.2022.100081","ISSN":"25902075","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"100081","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Out of control: The need for standardised solvent approaches and data reporting in antibiofilm assays incorporating dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO)","title-short":"Out of control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590207522000156","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"sunday2011","abstract":"A tenet of macroecology is that physiological processes of organisms are linked to large-scale geographical patterns in environmental conditions. Species at higher latitudes experience greater seasonal temperature variation and are consequently predicted to withstand greater temperature extremes. We tested for relationships between breadths of thermal tolerance in ectothermic animals and the latitude of specimen location using all available data, while accounting for habitat, hemisphere, methodological differences and taxonomic affinity. We found that thermal tolerance breadths generally increase with latitude, and do so at a greater rate in the Northern Hemisphere. In terrestrial ectotherms, upper thermal limits vary little while lower thermal limits decrease with latitude. By contrast, marine species display a coherent poleward decrease in both upper and lower thermal limits. Our findings provide comprehensive global support for hypotheses generated from studies at smaller taxonomic subsets and geographical scales. Our results further indicate differences between terrestrial and marine ectotherms in how thermal physiology varies with latitude that may relate to the degree of temperature variability experienced on land and in the ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sunday","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Bates","given":"Amanda E."},{"family":"Dulvy","given":"Nicholas K."}],"citation-key":"sunday2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2010.1295","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1713","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,22]]},"page":"1823-1830","PMCID":"PMC3097822","PMID":"21106582","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Global analysis of thermal tolerance and latitude in ectotherms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3097822/","volume":"278"},

Bankhead National Forest located in northwestern Alabama. We captured 2643 individuals representing 47 species (20 amphibians and 27 reptiles) during 3132 trap nights. Pre-treatment captures varied widely for both amphibians and reptiles among the stands designated for management, which was likely due to forest structural changes caused by tree mortality resulting from Southern Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) infestations. Within each amphibian and reptile species assemblage, we observed species-speciﬁc associations with speciﬁc treatments and environmental characteristics. In regards to individual species responses, Eastern Fence Lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) increased in thin-with-burn treatments and Green Anoles (Anolis carolinensis) tended to increase in all thinned stands. North American Racers (Coluber constrictor) increased in thin-only plots primarily during the second post-treatment year. Mississippi Slimy Salamander (Plethodon mississippi) captures tended to decrease in all treatment stands throughout the study period, which may been due to either drier environmental conditions during post-treatment sampling or natural population cycling. Pool-breeding amphibian captures were more likely related to the hydroperiod of aquatic breeding environments within 290 m of survey locations rather than forest treatments. Our results illustrate that forest restoration through tree thinning can positively inﬂuence certain reptile species with limited impacts on amphibians in upland, pine-dominated forests of northern Alabama. However, as our forest stands are scheduled to be burned every 3–5 years, continued monitoring is necessary to understand the impacts of repeated disturbances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Sutton","given":"William B."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Schweitzer","given":"Callie J."}],"citation-key":"sutton2013","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2012.12.047","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5]]},"language":"en","page":"213-227","source":"Crossref","title":"Amphibian and reptile responses to thinning and prescribed burning in mixed pine-hardwood forests of northwestern Alabama, USA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112713000145","volume":"295"},

We build upon recent progress and propose a new probabilistic method for determining niche region and pairwise niche overlap that can be extended beyond two dimensions, provides directional estimates of niche overlap, accounts for species-specific distributions in niche space, and, unlike geometric methods, produces consistent and unique bivariate projections of multivariate data. We define the niche region (NR) as a given 95% (or user-defined α) probability region in multivariate space. Overlap is calculated as the probability that an individual from species A is found in the NR of species B. Uncertainty is accounted for in a Bayesian framework, and is the only aspect of the methodology that depends on sample size. Application is illustrated with three-dimensional stable isotope data, but practitioners could use any continuous indicator of ecological niche in any number of dimensions.

Site selection was based on a history (within the district) of adult frog population declines and/or disappearances or records of infection of adult frogs or larvae by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Larvae were collected once from each creek site between October 2002 and October 2004, and were between Gosner developmental stages 25 and 40. Total body length ranged from 18 mm to 100 mm. Mouthparts were examined under a dissecting microscope for grossly visible abnormalities, and then examined for histologic evidence of B. dendrobatidis. The most consistent mouthpart abnormalities found were multifocal depigmentation of the jaw sheaths and loss or shortening of the tooth rows. At the individual larva level, presence of mouthpart abnormalities was strongly associated with histologic diagnosis of B. dendrobatidis (93%). At least one larva with abnormal mouthparts was detected at 12 of the 14 sites and histologic evidence of B. dendrobatidis was detected at 13 of the 14 sites. These findings suggest that larvae of Mixophyes species are suitable for surveillance for B. dendrobatidis. We conclude that surveillance of B. dendrobatidis where individual larva prevalences of mouthpart abnormalities and histologic evidence of B. dendrobatidis are as high as those observed in this study (66% and 78%, respectively), relatively small numbers of larvae are required to detect these infections. Medium to large larvae (body length .30 mm) were much more likely to be affected than small larvae (body length #30 mm), suggesting that larger individuals should be targeted for surveillance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Symonds","given":"Emma P."},{"family":"Hines","given":"Harry B."},{"family":"Bird","given":"Philip S."},{"family":"Morton","given":"John M."},{"family":"Mills","given":"Paul C."}],"citation-key":"symonds2007","container-title":"Journal of Wildlife Diseases","DOI":"10.7589/0090-3558-43.1.48","ISSN":"0090-3558","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1]]},"language":"en","page":"48-60","source":"Crossref","title":"Surveillance for <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> using <i>Mixophyes</i> (Anura: Myobatrachidae) larvae","title-short":"SURVEILLANCE FOR BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS USING MIXOPHYES (ANURA","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/10.7589/0090-3558-43.1.48","volume":"43"},

In some regions of the world (e.g., the Neotropics and Western United States), Bd has caused recent reductions in amphibian population abundance and species richness, while in other regions the impacts are less clear. Although Bd is present in the Midwestern United States, its history and impact in the region is not known. We used a qPCR assay to determine historic Bd prevalence in Illinois, testing 1028 specimens representing 10 anuran species, collected 1888–1989. We used two complementary sets of samples to ﬁrst assess historic prevalence with the primary set, and used a secondary set to conﬁrm Bd presence and examine older samples with a more sensitive technique. Prevalence varied among species; in the primary dataset of 1008 samples extracted with PrepMan Ultra collected 1892–1989, Bd was found in four species (11.1%, CI: 9.3–13.2%). Rana (Lithobates) sphenocephala, the southern leopard frog, had the highest prevalence (38.3%, CI 32.7–44.2%); prevalence among other infected species was <7%. Overall prevalence was <10% in most decades but >40% in the 1940s. In the secondary set of 50 samples extracted with Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kits (30 re-swabbed of the original 1008 and 20 additional older specimens), 17 of the 20 additional samples were Bd+ (85.0%, CI 64.0–94.8%) including the oldest Bd+ specimen, which was collected in 1888. We conﬁrmed Bd presence by sequencing 42 Bd+ samples and found P99% homology with Bd sequences in Genbank. By 1900, Bd was geographically widespread throughout Illinois—40 years earlier than the current oldest estimate in the U.S.—meaning that Illinois amphibians have been coexisting with Bd for at least 126 years. This long period of coexistence from our results raises new questions about the history of Bd in North America, possible coevolution between host and pathogen, and the potential role of Bd in historic population declines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Talley","given":"Brooke L."},{"family":"Muletz","given":"Carly R."},{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."},{"family":"Fleischer","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Lips","given":"Karen R."}],"citation-key":"talley2015","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.007","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"language":"en","page":"254-261","source":"Crossref","title":"A century of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Illinois amphibians (1888–1989)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320714004807","volume":"182"},

  {"id":"tapia2017","abstract":"We report the recent ﬁnding of four adults of Atelopus longirostris, a Critically Endangered species that was last seen in 1989, when catastrophic Atelopus declines occurred. The rediscovery of A. longirostris took place in a new locality, Junín, 1250–1480 m asl, Provincia Imbabura, Ecuador, on 28–31 March 2016. The four frogs were found in two isolated small patches of native forest in a fragmented area heavily modiﬁed for agriculture and livestock; one patch protected by the Junín Community Reserve, and another non-protected private patch near the reserve. We found high prevalence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in the amphibian community of Junín, but A. longirostris tested negative. The ﬁnding of A. longirostris after 27 years is surprising and ﬁts an apparent pattern of mild conditions that might be promoting either the recovery or persistence in low numbers of some relict amphibian populations. The frogs are the ﬁrst founders of an ex situ assurance colony in Jambatu Research and Conservation Center. Expansion of the Junín Community Reserve is urgently needed to add the currently non-protected patch of forest, where A. longirostris also occurs. The restoration of the forest in degraded areas between both forest patches and in the related river margins is also necessary. This restoration will grant the connectivity between both isolated metapopulations and the normal movement of individuals to the breeding sites in the Chalguayacu and Junín River basins. The latter should be protected to prevent any kind of water pollution by the opencast copper exploitation of the mining concession Llurimagua, which is underway. Atelopus longirostris belongs to a group of at least 29 species of Ecuadorian Atelopus that are critically endangered, 15 of which remain unsighted for at least one decade, and most of them might be extinct.

Among the most affected groups are the Harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus), nearly all of which are threatened with extinction. We monitored one of the last known Ecuadorian populations of Atelopus spumarius (Pebas Stubfoot Toad) with a mark–recapture survey between February 2009 and December 2010. We aimed to determine the effect of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), previously recorded at the site, on population size and survival. We also analyzed the effect of selective logging which occurred along the transect in April 2010. We tested every individual captured or recaptured for Bd presence using end-point PCR. All 679 Bd swabs (from 356 individuals) were negative, suggesting that Bd did not inﬂuence population size and survival. Population size increased during the ﬁrst 9 months of the study (August 2009–April 2010), from an estimated 47 to 92 individuals, but then decreased by November 2010 to an estimated 48 individuals. Probability of survival was 0.13 lower in months following selective logging compared to previous months; emigration decreased by 0.37 after the logging event. Pairs in amplexus were found between April and December, suggesting a long, if not year-round, reproductive period. Although most Atelopus spp. declines have been attributed to Bd, we present a case in which Bd has been detected in the area yet changes in population size cannot be attributed to chytridiomycosis. Analyses of survival and male body condition index suggest that the decline at the end of the study was the result of habitat destruction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Tarvin","given":"Rebecca D."},{"family":"Peña","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Ron","given":"Santiago R."}],"citation-key":"tarvin2014","container-title":"Journal of Herpetology","DOI":"10.1670/11-269","ISSN":"0022-1511","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9]]},"language":"en","page":"291-297","source":"Crossref","title":"Changes in population size and survival in <i>Atelopus spumarius</i> (Anura: Bufonidae) are not correlated with chytrid prevalence","title-short":"Changes in population size and survival in <i>atelopus spumarius</i> (anura","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1670/11-269","volume":"48"},

We investigated the venom from 13 individual coastal taipans Oxyuranus scutellatus from four localities on the north-east coast of Australia, spanning a distance of 2000 km. The intra-speciﬁc variation in taipan venom was considerably less than the inter-speciﬁc variation between it and the other Australian elapids to which it was compared. The electrophoretic venom proﬁle of O. scutellatus was visually diﬀerent to six other genera of Australian elapids, but not to its congener inland taipan O. microlepidotus. There was minimal geographical variation in taipan venom, as the intra-population variation exceeded the inter-population variation for enzymatic activity, procoagulant activity, and the abundance of neurotoxins. The pre-synaptic neurotoxin (taipoxin) was more abundant than the post-synaptic neurotoxins (3FTx), with a median of 11.0% (interquartile range (IQR): 9.7% to 18.3%; range: 6.7% to 23.6%) vs. a median of 3.4% (IQR: 0.4% to 6.7%; range: 0% to 8.1%). Three taipan individuals almost completely lacked post-synaptic neurotoxins, which was not associated with geography and occurred within two populations. We found no evidence of sexual dimorphism in taipan venom. Our study provides a basis for evaluating the signiﬁcance of intra-speciﬁc venom variation within a phylogenetic context by comparing it to the inter-speciﬁc and inter-generic variation.

Despite its importance to the theory and application of population ecology, and to conservation biology, quantifying the role and strength of density dependence is particularly challenging. We present a hierarchical formulation of the temporal symmetry approach, also known as the Pradel model, that permits estimation of the strength of density dependence from capture–mark–reencounter data. A measure of relative population size is built in the model and serves to detect density dependence directly on population growth rate. The model is also extended to account for temporal random variability in demographic rates, allowing estimation of the temporal variance of population growth rate unexplained by density dependence. We thus present a model-based approach that enable to test and quantify the effect of density-dependent and density-independent factors affecting population fluctuations in a single modeling framework.

The models illustrate the relative importance of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, absorbed solar and thermal radiation, substrate temperature, and soil H\"2O potential on the core temperatures, hydration levels, and rates of hydration level change during desiccation and rehydration for leopard frogs of different size. Leopard frogs' core temperatures are influenced most by ambient air and substrate temperatures, whereas absorbed radiation has a subordinant effect. Evaporative H\"2O loss rates are strongly influenced by absorbed radiation and virtually not influenced at all by substrate temperature (relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed were also shown to be strongly influential on evaporative H\"2O loss). Water uptake from wet soils (@j\"s\"o\"i\"l > -150 mb) is determined primarily by the properties of the frog, whereas H\"2O uptake from relatively drier soils (@j\"s\"o\"i\"l < -300 mb) is determined by the conductive properties of the soil. Results of computer simulations suggest that leopard frogs in southern Wisconsin environments should not be found at great distances from standing H\"2O or soils with H\"2O potentials < -150 mb. Data taken from the literature and viewed in context of the theory of H\"2O exchange between an amphibian and soil, suggests that leopard frogs may rarely venture from saturated soils (@j \"s\"o\"i\"l = 0). Results of simulations also imply that leopard frogs in most natural environmental circumstances will not generally have core temperatures greatly different from ambient air temperatures; thus, implying that any behavioral thermoregulatory ability would likely be crude.

Frogs can avoid rapid desiccation with high Rc, a large body size, or some combination of these traits. Our literature survey indicates that frogs with a combination of Rc and body size that would result in long times to desiccate to 70% of standard mass tend to be arboreal, suggesting that those species may be selectively favored in a niche that often requires frogs to be away from water sources for extended periods of time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Tracy","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Christian","given":"Keith A."},{"family":"Tracy","given":"C.

We study combinations of existing methods, which are shown to vastly improve computational efﬁciency for these hierarchical models while maintaining the modeling ﬂexibility provided by embedded HMMs. The methods include discrete ﬁltering of the HMM likelihood to remove latent states, reduced data representations, and a novel procedure for dynamic block sampling of posterior dimensions.

Here, we synthesize current knowledge on the role of temperature as a driver of the pathogenicity and virulence of Bd to better understand the effects of temperature on amphibian defense mechanisms against infection. This review advises on research direction and management approaches to benefit amphibian populations affected by Bd. We conclude by offering guidelines for four levels of temperature monitoring in amphibian field studies to improve consistency between studies: regional climate, habitat, microhabitat, and amphibian host.","author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Wassens","given":"Skye"},{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"turner2021","container-title":"Journal of Wildlife Diseases","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Temperature as a driver of the pathogenicity and virulence of amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis: a systematic review","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"turner2022","abstract":"Threatening processes, such as disease, can drive major changes in population demographics of the host. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has led to the decline of at least 500 amphibian species across the globe and has been shown to truncate host age structure by lowering adult survival rates. This results in heavy reliance on annual recruitment and the inability to recover in the event of periodic recruitment failure. We used skeletochronology to determine the age structure, growth, and survival rates of populations of an endangered amphibian, Litoria raniformis, with endemic chytridiomycosis, across two climatically disparate regions in south-­eastern Australia: semi-­arid and temperate. Contrary to predictions, populations in the semi-­arid region (in which chytrid prevalence is substantially lower due to high temperatures) displayed a more truncated age structure than populations in the temperate study regions. Maximum recorded age was only two years in the semi-­arid region compared with up to four years in the temperate region. Wetland hydroperiod and average seasonal air temperature were correlated with age, and males had a slightly higher survival rate than females (0.31 for males and 0.27 for females). Despite the previously documented differences in chytrid prevalence between the two climatic regions, water availability and wetland hydroperiods appear the over-­riding determinants of the age structure and survival rates of L. raniformis. Targeted management which ensures water availability and improves survival of 1-­year-­old frogs into their second and third breeding season would reduce the impact of stochastic events on L. raniformis, and this may be true for numerous frog species susceptible to chytridiomycosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Heard","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Wassens","given":"Skye"}],"citation-key":"turner2022","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.9123","ISSN":"2045-7758, 2045-7758","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Age structure of amphibian populations with endemic chytridiomycosis, across climatic regions with markedly different infection risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.9123","volume":"12"},

Here, we argue that a deeper integration of life-history theory into disease ecology is timely and necessary to improve our capacity to understand, predict and mitigate the impact of endemic and emerging infectious diseases in wild populations. Using wild vertebrates as an example, we show that host life-history characteristics influence host responses to parasitism at different levels of organisation, from individuals to communities.

I tested this prediction by measuring the behavioral and morphological responses to aeshnid dragonﬂy larvae of 16 tadpole species and asking whether predator-induced plasticity is greater in species that experience more variable densities of predators in nature. Tadpole phenotypes were measured in a series of similar experiments in outdoor artiﬁcial ponds carried out over a 9-yr period. I quantiﬁed tadpole habitats by soliciting evaluations by seven to 36 experienced ﬁeld observers for each species. There were large differences among species in phenotype, mostly in agreement with earlier descriptions. Nearly all species responded to dragonﬂies by decreasing activity and body length relative to overall body size and by increasing relative tail ﬁn depth, although the magnitude of the responses differed among species. There was a signiﬁcant positive phylogenetic correlation between morphological plasticity and variability in exposure to predators, thus upholding the adaptive hypothesis. The correlation between behavioral responses and habitat variability was not signiﬁcant, and there was little relationship between behavioral and morphological plasticity, raising the possibility that behavioral responses evolve under different scales of environmental variation than morphological responses.","author":[{"family":"Van Buskirk","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"vanbuskirk2002","container-title":"The American Naturalist","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","page":"16","source":"Zotero","title":"A comparative test of the adaptive plasticity hypothesis: Relationships between habitat and phenotype in anuran larvae","type":"article-journal","volume":"160"},
  {"id":"vanbuskirk2009","abstract":"Phenotypic plasticity has been studied intensively in experimental settings but infrequently in nature, and therefore the relevance of experimental ﬁndings is poorly known. This is especially true for morphological plasticity in amphibian larvae induced by predators and competitors. This paper describes a seven-year survey of head and tail shape in eight species of anuran and newt larvae in northern Switzerland, involving 6824 individual larvae and 59 ponds. I tested relationships between geometric measures of size and shape and ﬁve habitat gradients: pond permanence, cover by forest canopy and aquatic vegetation, and the densities of predators and competitors. Responses to competitors and predators were often similar to those reported in experiments. High competitor density was associated with small size and a large head in newt larvae, a long or deep head/body in anuran larvae, and a short or shallow tail in newts and some tadpoles. High predator density was correlated with a deep tail ﬁn and tail muscle in many species. In anurans, the change in shape between low- and highpredator ponds in nature closely paralleled the plastic response to nonlethal predators in mesocosm experiments. The survey revealed many previously undescribed relationships between morphology and the other habitat features. Several species had relatively large tails in ponds that were shaded or thickly vegetated. Associations between year-to-year changes in shape and habitat within ponds implicated phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic population divergence, at least in anurans. These results inspire conﬁdence in the relevance of experiments and highlight many new patterns that will merit further study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Buskirk","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"vanbuskirk2009","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.1890/08-1692.1","ISSN":"0012-9615","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11]]},"language":"en","page":"681-705","source":"Crossref","title":"Natural variation in morphology of larval amphibians: Phenotypic plasticity in nature?","title-short":"Natural variation in morphology of larval amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/08-1692.1","volume":"79"},

The nutritional environment provided to a fetus is an important source of developmental plasticity. Reptiles are a particularly interesting system to study this plasticity because of their varied routes of maternal nutrient allocation to reproduction. Most reptiles provide their offspring with all or most of the nutrients they require in egg yolk (lecithotrophy) while viviparous reptiles also provide their offspring with nutrients via a placenta (placentotrophy). We review the ways in which both lecithotrophy and placentotrophy can lead to differences in the nutrients embryonic reptiles receive, and discuss how these differences lead to developmental plasticity in offspring phenotype. We finish by reviewing the ecological and conservation consequences of nutritional-driven developmental plasticity in reptiles. If nutritional-driven developmental plasticity has fitness consequences, then understanding the basis of this plasticity has exciting potential to identify how reptile recruitment is affected by environmental changes in food supply. Such knowledge is critical to our ability to protect taxa threatened by environmental change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dyke","given":"James U."},{"family":"Griffith","given":"Oliver W."}],"citation-key":"vandyke2018","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological and Integrative Physiology","DOI":"10.1002/jez.2165","ISSN":"24715638","issue":"6-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","page":"275-286","source":"Crossref","title":"Mechanisms of reproductive allocation as drivers of developmental plasticity in reptiles","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jez.2165","volume":"329"},

Blue-spotted Salamander occupancy was more than twice as high as Tiger Salamander occupancy. Detection probability for both species was substantially <1 and was inﬂuenced by both survey and landscape covariates. Prescribed ﬁre was an important predictor of colonization for Blue-spotted Salamanders and both species exhibited higher rates of colonization at sites near breeding wetlands. Overall rates of turnover were low for both species. Our results reveal that salamander populations can persist in highly fragmented urban preserve systems.

Infectious drivers of these declines include the recently emerged fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Chytridiomycota). The skin disease caused by these fungi is named chytridiomycosis and affects the vital function of amphibian skin. Not all amphibians respond equally to infection and host responses might range from resistant, over tolerant to susceptible. The clinical outcome of infection is highly dependent on the amphibian host, the fungal virulence and environmental determinants. B. dendrobatidis infects the skin of a large range of anurans, urodeles and caecilians, whereas to date the host range of B. salamandrivorans seems limited to urodeles. So far, the epidemic of B. dendrobatidis is mainly limited to Australian, neotropical, South European and West American amphibians, while for B. salamandrivorans it is limited to European salamanders. Other striking differences between both fungi include gross pathology and thermal preferences. With this review we aim to provide the reader with a state-of-the art of host-pathogen interactions for both fungi, in which new data pertaining to the interaction of B. dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans with the host’s skin are integrated.

As such, frog skin is an important innate immune organ and ﬁrst line of defence against pathogens in the environment. Critical to the innate immune functions of frog skin are the maintenance of physical, chemical, cellular, and microbiological barriers and the complex network of interactions that occur across all the barriers. Despite the global decline in amphibian populations, largely as a result of emerging infectious diseases, we understand little regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the innate immune function of amphibian skin and defence against pathogens. In this review, we discuss the structure, cell composition and cellular junctions that contribute to the skin physical barrier, the antimicrobial peptide arsenal that, in part, comprises the chemical barrier, the pattern recognition receptors involved in recognizing pathogens and initiating innate immune responses in the skin, and the contribution of commensal microbes on the skin to pathogen defence. We brieﬂy discuss the inﬂuence of environmental abiotic factors (natural and anthropogenic) and pathogens on the immunocompetency of frog skin defences. Although some aspects of frog innate immunity, such as antimicrobial peptides are well-studied; other components and how they contribute to the skin innate immune barrier, are lacking. Elucidating the complex network of interactions occurring at the interface of the frog’s external and internal environments will yield insight into the crucial role amphibian skin plays in host defence and the environmental factors leading to compromised barrier integrity, disease, and host mortality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Varga","given":"Joseph F.

  {"id":"vehtari2017","abstract":"Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a ﬁtted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efﬁcient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights.

  {"id":"venesky2009","abstract":"Pathogen-induced modiﬁcations in host behavior, including alterations in foraging behavior or foraging efﬁciency, can compromise host ﬁtness by reducing growth and development. Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and it has played an important role in the worldwide decline of amphibians. In larval anurans, Bd infections commonly result in reduced developmental rates, however, the mechanism(s) responsible are untested. We conducted laboratory experiments to test whether Bd infections reduced foraging performance of Grey Treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) and Fowler’s Toad (Anaxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri) tadpoles. In the ﬁrst experiment, we observed foraging behavior of Bd-infected and uninfected tadpoles to test for differences in foraging activity. In a second experiment, we tested for differences in the ingestion rates of tadpoles by examining the amount of food in their alimentary track after a 3-hour foraging period. We hypothesized that Bd-infected tadpoles would forage less often and less efﬁciently than uninfected tadpoles. As predicted, Bd-infected larvae forage less often and were less efﬁcient at obtaining food than uninfected larvae. Our results show that Bd infections reduce foraging efﬁciency in Anaxyrus and Hyla tadpoles, and that Bd differentially affects foraging behavior in these species. Thus, our results provide a potential mechanism of decreased developmental rates of Bd-infected tadpoles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Venesky","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Parris","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Storfer","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"venesky2009","container-title":"EcoHealth","DOI":"10.1007/s10393-009-0272-7","ISSN":"1612-9202, 1612-9210","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","page":"565-575","source":"Crossref","title":"Impacts of <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> infection on tadpole foraging performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10393-009-0272-7","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"vontakach2020","abstract":"Aim Investigation of realized niche contraction in declining species can help us understand how and where threats are being either mediated or tolerated across landscapes. It also provides insights into species' sensitivity to environmental change that are unable to be identified through analysis of declines in range size or abundance alone. Here, we apply the recently proposed 'niche reduction hypothesis' to investigate relationships between trends in niche breadth and geographic distribution of declining species. Location Northern Australia. Methods We compare and contrast contemporary and historical data sets to examine the relationship between extent of occurrence (EOO) and realized niche hypervolume, and investigate changes in species' utilization of environmental space through time via generalized linear modelling and bootstrapping of historical values. We also use the 'Maxent' algorithm to create and stack contemporary and historical ecological niche models (ENMs) and identify regions where resilience to threatening processes is maximized. Results We found larger mean reductions in niche hypervolume (39%) than EOO (30.5%), with little correlation (r = 0.07) between the two measures, suggesting that contraction of realized niche breadth can be largely independent of reduction in EOO. We also identified a general set of environmental conditions towards which species' realized niches contracted. Comparison of stacked ENMs allowed us to identify regions of natural refuge where environmental conditions are associated with increased species resilience to threats, and conversely, regions where habitat suitability has declined. Main conclusions Examining species declines from an ecological niche perspective provides a powerful tool for understanding how environmental conditions, biotic interactions and species traits shape responses to local and global environmental changes. Quantifying reductions in niche breadth is crucial as contraction to a narrower subset of environmental space can reduce a species' ability to tolerate other threats and potentially lower adaptive capacity and genetic diversity, increasing extinction risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Takach","given":"Brenton","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Scheele","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Moore","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Brett P."},{"family":"Banks","given":"Sam C."}],"citation-key":"vontakach2020","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.13145","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"1467-1482","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Patterns of niche contraction identify vital refuge areas for declining mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.13145","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"voyles2007","abstract":"Mounting evidence implicates the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, in global amphibian declines and extinctions. While the virulence of this disease has been clearly demonstrated, there is, as yet, no mechanistic explanation for how B. dendrobatidis kills amphibians. To investigate the pathology of chytridiomycosis, blood samples were collected from uninfected, aclinically infected and clinically diseased amphibians and analyzed for a wide range of biochemical and hematological parameters. Here, we show that green tree frogs Litoria caerulea with severe chytridiomycosis had reduced plasma osmolality, sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride concentrations. Stable plasma albumin, hematocrit and urea levels indicated that hydration status was unaffected, signifying depletion of electrolytes from circulation rather than dilution due to increased water uptake. We suggest that B. dendrobatidis kills amphibians by disrupting normal epidermal functioning, leading to osmotic imbalance through loss of electrolytes. Determining how B. dendrobatidis kills amphibians is fundamental to understanding the host –pathogen relationship and thus the population declines attributed to B. dendrobatidis. Understanding the mechanisms of mortality may also explain interspecific variation in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Voyles","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Young","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Speare","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Webb","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Warner","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Rudd","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."}],"citation-key":"voyles2007","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao01838","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,14]]},"language":"en","page":"113-118","source":"Crossref","title":"Electrolyte depletion and osmotic imbalance in amphibians with chytridiomycosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v77/n2/p113-118/","volume":"77"},

  {"id":"voyles2014","abstract":"Virulence of infectious pathogens can be unstable and evolve rapidly depending on the evolutionary dynamics of the organism. Experimental evolution can be used to characterize pathogen evolution, often with the underlying objective of understanding evolution of virulence. We used experimental evolution techniques (serial transfer experiments) to investigate differential growth and virulence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen that causes amphibian chytridiomycosis. We tested two lineages of Bd that were derived from a single cryo-archived isolate; one lineage (P10) was passaged 10 times, whereas the second lineage (P50) was passaged 50 times. We quantiﬁed time to zoospore release, maximum zoospore densities, and timing of zoospore activity and then modeled population growth rates. We also conducted exposure experiments with a susceptible amphibian species, the common green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) to test the differential pathogenicity. We found that the P50 lineage had shorter time to zoospore production (Tmin), faster rate of sporangia death (ds), and an overall greater intrinsic population growth rate (k). These patterns of population growth in vitro corresponded with higher prevalence and intensities of infection in exposed Litoria caerulea, although the differences were not signiﬁcant. Our results corroborate studies that suggest that Bd may be able to evolve relatively rapidly. Our ﬁndings also challenge the general assumption that pathogens will always attenuate in culture because shifts in Bd virulence may depend on laboratory culturing practices. These ﬁndings have practical implications for the laboratory maintenance of Bd isolates and underscore the importance of understanding the evolution of virulence in amphibian chytridiomycosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Voyles","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Leah R."},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Cheryl J."},{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Skerratt","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Speare","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Rosenblum","given":"Erica Bree"}],"citation-key":"voyles2014","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.1199","ISSN":"20457758","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9]]},"language":"en","page":"3633-3641","source":"Crossref","title":"Experimental evolution alters the rate and temporal pattern of population growth in <i>Batrachochytrium <span class=\"nocase\">dendrobatidis</span></i> , a lethal fungal pathogen of amphibians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.1199","volume":"4"},

Outbreaks of the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), have caused the decline and extinction of numerous amphibian species. In Costa Rica, a major decline event occurred in 1987, more than two decades before this pathogen was discovered. The loss of many species in Costa Rica is assumed to be due to Bd-epizootics, but there are few studies that provide data from amphibians in the time leading up to the proposed epizootics. In this study, we provide new data on Bd infection rates of amphibians collected throughout Costa Rica, in the decades prior to the epizootics. We used a quantitative PCR assay to test for Bd infection in 1016 specimens collected throughout Costa Rica. We found Bd-infected hosts collected as early as 1964, and a infection prevalence average per decade of just 4%. The infection prevalence remained relatively low and geographically constrained until the 1980s when epizootics are hypothesized to have occurred. After that time, infection prevalence increased three-fold and Bd-infected hosts we collected throughout the entire country.  Our results, suggest that Bd may either have invaded Costa Rica earlier than previously known, and spread more slowly than previously reported, or that an endemic lineage of the pathogen may exists. To help visualize areas where future studies should take place, we provide a Bd habitat suitability model trained with local data.  Studies that provide information on genetic lineages of Bd are needed to determine whether an endemic lineage of Bd or the Global Panzootic Lineage (identified from mass die off sites globally) was present in Costa Rica and responsible for the epizootics that caused amphibian communities to collapse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Vredenburg","given":"Vance T."},{"family":"De León","given":"Marina E."},{"family":"Zumbado-Ulate","given":"Héctor"},{"family":"García-Rodríguez","given":"Adrián"},{"family":"Alvarado","given":"Gilbert"},{"family":"Sulaeman","given":"Hasan"},{"family":"Bolaños","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"vredenburg2018","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/482968","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,29]]},"language":"en","source":"DataCite","title":"Prevalence of the fungal pathogen <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in amphibians of Costa Rica predated first-known epizootic","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/482968"},

  {"id":"waddle2019","abstract":"Amphibian declines caused by chytridiomycosis have been severe, but some susceptible populations have persisted or even recovered. Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31–38), metamorphs (stage 45–46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were 5.5 times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Waddle","given":"Anthony W."},{"family":"Levy","given":"Joshua E."},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Rebeca"},{"family":"Breukelen","given":"Frank","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Nash","given":"Maliha"},{"family":"Jaeger","given":"Jef R."}],"citation-key":"waddle2019","container-title":"EcoHealth","DOI":"10.1007/s10393-019-01446-y","ISSN":"1612-9202, 1612-9210","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"701-711","source":"Crossref","title":"Population-level resistance to chytridiomycosis is life-stage dependent in an imperiled anuran","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10393-019-01446-y","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"wakefield2019","abstract":"The nominate subspecies of the Pacific Gull Larus pacificus, widespread along the coast of southern Australia, may be under threat from the slightly smaller, but opportunistically competitive, self-introduced Kelp Gull L. dominicanus. To assess this threat to the Pacific Gull in Tasmania, we documented colony size of large gulls across many Tasmanian islands over a period of 24 breeding seasons (1985–2009). The most northerly Kelp Gull nests on the Tasmanian mainland were located at Paddys Island, St Helens. There were no reports of Kelp Gulls along any part of the northern coast of Tasmania abutting Bass Strait, although there were sporadic sightings on islands of the Furneaux Group. The stronghold of the Kelp Gull in Tasmania is the Estuary of the Derwent River and its surrounding bays and channels, where this species is present in much larger numbers than the Pacific Gull, but nevertheless co-exists with that species. We found no evidence for dramatic changes in numbers since 1985. All Pacific Gull nests were on small islands, and there were none at Orielton Lagoon, which became the third biggest Kelp Gull colony studied in the south-east of Tasmania. At the largest Kelp Gull colony (Green Island), the number of Pacific Gull nests declined while numbers of Kelp Gull nests increased, but no such inverse correlation was observed elsewhere, including Curlew and Hog Islands, where numbers of Kelp Gull nests increased. We conclude that numbers of Pacific Gulls have remained reasonably stable, despite increases in Kelp Gull nests at certain sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wakefield","given":"William"},{"family":"Wakefield","given":"Els"},{"family":"Ratkowsky","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"wakefield2019","container-title":"Australian Field Ornithology","DOI":"10.20938/afo36047055","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"47-55","source":"Crossref","title":"Are kelp gulls <i>Larus dominicanus</i> replacing pacific gulls <i>L. pacificus</i> in Tasmania?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.birdlife.org.au/afo/index.php/afo/article/view/2145/2167","volume":"36"},

Chytridiomycosis, a major cause of amphibian population declines, is a skin disease caused by the fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In a factorial experiment, bullfrog skin microbiota was reduced with antibiotics, augmented with an anti-Bd bacterial isolate (Janthinobacterium lividum), or unmanipulated, and individuals were then either exposed or not exposed to Bd. We found that the microbial community structure of individual frogs prior to Bd exposure influenced Bd infection intensity one week following exposure, which, in turn, was negatively correlated with proportional growth during the experiment. Microbial community structure and function differed among unmanipulated, antibiotic-treated, and augmented frogs only when frogs were exposed to Bd.

  {"id":"walker2010","abstract":"Amphibian chytridiomycosis is a disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Whether Bd is a new emerging pathogen (the novel pathogen hypothesis; NPH) or whether environmental changes are exacerbating the host-pathogen dynamic (the endemic pathogen hypothesis; EPH) is debated. To disentangle these hypotheses we map the distribution of Bd and chytridiomycosis across the Iberian Peninsula centred on the first European outbreak site. We find that the infection-free state is the norm across both sample sites and individuals. To analyse this dataset, we use Bayesian zero-inflated binomial models to test whether environmental variables can account for heterogeneity in both the presence and prevalence of Bd, and heterogeneity in the occurrence of the disease, chytridiomycosis. We also search for signatures of Bd-spread within Iberia using genotyping. We show (1) no evidence for any relationship between the presence of Bd and environmental variables, (2) a weak relationship between environmental variables and the conditional prevalence of infection, (3) stage-dependent heterogeneity in the infection risk, (4) a strong association between altitude and chytridiomycosis, (5) multiple Iberian genotypes and (6) recent introduction and spread of a single genotype of Bd in the Pyrenees. We conclude that the NPH is consistent with the emergence of Bd in Iberia. However, epizootic forcing of infection is tied to location and shaped by both biotic and abiotic variables. Therefore, the population-level consequences of disease introduction are explained by EPH-like processes. This study demonstrates the power of combining surveillance and molecular data to ascertain the drivers of new emerging infections diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Susan F."},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Virgilio"},{"family":"Garner","given":"Trenton W.

We placed our phylogeographic study of P. ridens within a larger molecular phylogenetic analysis of Central American Pristimantis. All phylogenetic inferences were based on a 1455 base pair fragment of mitochondrial DNA, containing the complete ND2 gene and ﬁve ﬂanking tRNA genes. Our reconstruction of the intraspeciﬁc phylogeny of P. ridens yielded a basal trichotomy dating to an estimated 12+ million years ago (Ma), consisting of central Panama, western Panama, and Costa Rica plus Honduras. Thus, the presence of P. ridens appears to predate the completion of the Isthmus 3.1 Ma. Using a parametric bootstrap (SOWH) test, we evaluated four a priori zoogeographic hypotheses for the origin and spread of P. ridens. This analysis suggested that the P. ridens populations on the Caribbean versant of Costa Rica were established by Paciﬁc versant ancestors only recently, in contrast to the very old lineages found in Panama.

The lowland rainforests of the southeastern Amazon harbour exceptionally high amphibian diversity, but also face a range of threats including habitat modification caused by forest fires. In this study, we sampled amphibians in areas of forest in Madre de Dios, Peru, that were affected by anthropogenic fires following severe drought in 2005. Two forest types, bamboo and terra-firme, were assessed. Forty-two anuran species were recorded in 22 survey nights. Amphibian diversity and abundance were not significantly different in burned areas of either forest type, and amphibian community composition did not change significantly between burned and unburned forests within any forest type, while bamboo forest was found to support a distinctly different amphibian assemblage to terra-firme forest. Our results suggest that further sampling over wider spatial and temporal scales to encompass a greater range of fire impacts could consolidate insights into the effects of fire on anuran communities in this region, and help to highlight the conservation value of these disturbed forests. These preliminary results are novel and enhance our understanding of how tropical forest fires may affect amphibian communities. The data also highlight the conservation value of forests affected by a fire event, as they harboured large numbers of anuran species known in the region.

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Warton","given":"David I."},{"family":"Hui","given":"Francis K.

Data were drawn from repeat surveys of 16 wetlands over a 3-year period (2008–2011). Detection probabilities of each method and species combination were determined by maximum likelihood estimation. Audio-visual surveys targeting adults had a higher probability of detecting individual species than did methods targeting their tadpoles. However, the presence of adults was a reasonably poor indicator of the presence of their tadpoles on any given survey occasion. Of the methods employed to target tadpoles, large and small fyke nets had a significantly higher probability of detecting tadpoles of all species than did bait traps, seining or sweep nets.

We employed a habitat-based, stratiﬁed sampling design to assess the impacts of these sediments on the densities of aquatic amphibians in ﬁve impacted streams by comparing them with densities in ﬁve adjacent, unimpacted (control) streams. Three species were sampled in numbers sufﬁcient to be informative: tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei, larvae), Paciﬁc giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus, paedomorphs and larvae), and southern torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton variegatus, adults and larvae). Densities of amphibians were signiﬁcantly lower in the streams impacted by sediment. While sediment effects were species speciﬁc, reﬂecting differential use of stream microhabitats, the shared vulnerability of these species to infusions of ﬁne sediments is probably the result of their common reliance on interstitial spaces in the streambed matrix for critical life requisites, such as cover and foraging. Many streamdwelling amphibians are highly philopatric and long-lived, and they exist in relatively stable populations.

  {"id":"west2020a","abstract":"Understanding why related species have differing population-level responses to threats can be key to identifying conservation options for declining populations. However, this is difficult when multiple threats are implicated. Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis: Bd) is implicated in at least 500 amphibian population declines globally, although few tangible options exist to mitigate pathogen impacts. Other threatening processes also invariably operate on most amphibians. Non-native fish, for example, can contribute to amphibian declines and may exacerbate Bd impacts. We disentangled the impacts of Bd and non-native fish upon two stream breeding frog species with differing conservation statuses to reveal vital rates that are crucial for species persistence. Litoria spenceri are threatened and historically occurred at elevations between 300–1100 m asl in southeastern Australia. Litoria lesueurii are non-threatened and sympatric with L. spenceri at some sites. Using mark-recapture derived demographic rates known to correlate with climate and elevation, discrete-time deterministic population models were constructed for each species at high, moderate and low elevation sites, and multiple management scenarios. Our study reveals that age to maturation, clutch size and egg-year 1 survival influenced interspecific and intraspecific population-level responses of the two frogs to Bd impacts. Importantly, our results highlight that an amphibian population’s capacity to counteract Bd-mediated adult mortality is clearly constrained by other threats and environment interactions that moderate species recruitment. Furthermore, understanding limits to recruitment may help identify Bd mitigation strategies. In our study, disease mitigation may be best achieved at some sites by enhancing recruitment through non-native fish management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"West","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Todd","given":"Charles R."},{"family":"Gillespie","given":"Graeme R."},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"west2020a","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108247","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","page":"108247","source":"Crossref","title":"Recruitment is key to understanding amphibian’s different population-level responses to chytrid fungus infection","title-short":"Title","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320719309991","volume":"241"},

The success or failure of each translocation has provided insights into the habitat requirements and management of bell frogs. In unsuccessful translocations, the reasons for the inability to establish a permanent population became more apparent with monitoring; at Botany, young bell frogs failed to survive the winter because of inadequate or inappropriate over-winter habitat being available; at Long Reef, foraging and breeding habitat were inadequate; at Marrickville, urban predators and disease eliminated frogs. Other factors also appear to have a significant effect on the likely outcome of the translocation. These include: the proximity of a source population, the presence or absence of predatory fish, pond water temperature and the timing of the release of tadpoles at translocation sites.

Vegetation mounds were trialled and monitored for 26 months to determine if they could provide shelter conditions for Green and Golden Bell frogs. Covered and uncovered mounds were monitored at two sites (Arncliffe and Woonona) and both types of mounds were utilised by Bell frogs. Most frogs using the mounds for shelter remained active while inside the mounds, a few became torpid while in the mounds. The use of the mounds was influenced by ambient weather conditions. Vegetation mounds have a management advantage over other types of over-winter habitat in that they are portable, cheap and easy to maintain and easy to monitor. In addition, they provide a thermal and humidity gradient and allow frogs to move within the mound to select the preferred microhabitat conditions. As mounds temperatures are above ambient temperatures during winter, they may also assist in reducing the susceptibility of over-wintering frogs to chytrid infection. More detailed studies are needed to determine the optimal size, composition and best management use of the mounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"A.

  {"id":"whitfield2017","abstract":"Global amphibian biodiversity has declined dramatically in the past 4 decades, and many amphibian species have declined to near extinction as a result of emergence of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, persistent or recovering populations of several amphibian species have recently been rediscovered, and such populations may illustrate how amphibian species that are highly susceptible to chytridiomycosis may survive in the presence of Bd. We conducted field surveys for Bd infection in 7 species of Costa Rican amphibians (all species that have declined to near extinction but for which isolated populations persist) to characterize infection profiles in highly Bd-susceptible amphibians post-decline. We found highly variable patterns in infection, with some species showing low prevalence (~10%) and low infection intensity and others showing high infection prevalence (> 80%) and either low or high infection intensity. Across sites, infection rates were negatively associated with mean annual precipitation, and infection intensity across sites was negatively associated with mean average temperatures. Our results illustrate that even the most Bd-susceptible amphibians can persist in Bd-enzootic ecosystems, and that multiple ecological or evolutionary mechanisms likely exist for host−pathogen co-existence between Bd and the most Bd-susceptible amphibian species. Continued monitoring of these populations is necessary to evaluate population trends (continuing decline, stability, or population growth). These results should inform efforts to mitigate impacts of Bd on amphibians in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitfield","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Alvarado","given":"Gilbert"},{"family":"Abarca","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Zumbado","given":"Hector"},{"family":"Zuñiga","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Wainwright","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Kerby","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"whitfield2017","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao03154","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,20]]},"language":"en","page":"33-41","source":"Crossref","title":"Differential patterns of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection in relict amphibian populations following severe disease-associated declines","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v126/n1/p33-41/","volume":"126"},

Responses of coldwater stream biota to single wildﬁres are well studied, but measured responses to consecutive wildﬁres in warmwater systems that often include mixed assemblages of native and nonnative taxa are lacking. We quantiﬁed changes in physical habitat, resource availability, and biomass of cold- and warmwater oligochaetes, insects, crayﬁsh, ﬁshes, and tadpoles following consecutive megaﬁres (covering >100 km2) in the upper Gila River, New Mexico, USA. We were particularly interested in comparing responses of native and nonnative ﬁshes that might have evolved under diﬀerent disturbance regimes. Changes in habitat and resource availability were related to cumulative ﬁre eﬀects, ﬁre size, and postﬁre precipitation. The 2nd of 2 consecutive wildﬁres in the basin was larger and, coupled with moderate postﬁre discharge, resulted in increased siltation and decreased algal biomass. Several insect taxa responded to these ﬁres with reduced biomass, whereas oligochaete biomass was unaﬀected. Biomass of 6 of 7 native ﬁsh species decreased after the ﬁres, and decreases were associated with site proximity to ﬁre. Nonnative ﬁsh decreases after ﬁre were most pronounced for coldwater salmonids, and warmwater nonnative ﬁshes exhibited limited responses. All crayﬁsh and tadpoles collected were nonnative and were unresponsive to ﬁre disturbance. More pronounced responses of native insects and ﬁshes to ﬁres indicate that increasing ﬁre size and frequency threatens the persistence of native fauna and suggests that management activities promoting ecosystem resilience might help ameliorate wildﬁre eﬀects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitney","given":"James E."},{"family":"Gido","given":"Keith B."},{"family":"Pilger","given":"Tyler J."},{"family":"Propst","given":"David L."},{"family":"Turner","given":"Thomas F."}],"citation-key":"whitney2015","container-title":"Freshwater Science","DOI":"10.1086/683391","ISSN":"2161-9549, 2161-9565","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1510-1526","source":"Crossref","title":"Consecutive wildfires affect stream biota in cold- and warmwater dryland river networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/683391","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"wilber2015","abstract":"Aim The recently proposed maximum entropy theory of ecology predicts that all nested species–area relationships (SARs) will collapse to a single, universal curve that exhibits a decreasing log–log slope with increasing scale, suggesting that the power law form of the SAR is invalid at any scale. In this analysis we test the generality of this scale collapse behaviour and determine the scale at which approximate power law behaviour of the SAR is predicted to occur. Location Global. Methods We use common SAR models to recursively upscale SARs to (1) look for scale collapse of SARs built from different community assumptions and (2) identify the scale at which approximate power law SARs are recovered. We explore four SAR models in which species abundance distributions and the spatial aggregation of species vary within and across scales according to observed patterns. Results We show that scale collapse is a property of nested SARs, not of maximum entropy theory, and that many types of SARs can exhibit scale-collapsed curves that follow the general pattern of empirical communities. Moreover, we use the scale-collapsed curves to show that power law behaviour is not predicted to occur at the scale of most SAR studies and that variation in species spatial aggregation or the scaling of species abundance distributions are needed to produce power law SARs at realistic scales. Main conclusions Our findings show that power law behaviour of nested SARs is rare and that communities displaying approximate power law SARs may exhibit predictable characteristics within and across scale, such as interspecific variation in aggregation. Our findings regarding the general rarity of power law behaviour suggests that careful consideration of the curvature of a SAR and the scale of an ecological community are necessary before using power law SARs to predict biodiversity across scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilber","given":"Mark Q."},{"family":"Kitzes","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Harte","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"wilber2015","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12309","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"883-895","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Scale collapse and the emergence of the power law species–area relationship","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12309","volume":"24"},

Using a combination of models and experiments on an amphibian species suffering extirpations from the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), we show that while transmission from an environmental Bd reservoir increased the ability of Bd to invade an amphibian population and the extinction risk of that population, Bd-induced extinction dynamics were far more sensitive to host resistance and tolerance than to Bd transmission.

  {"id":"wilber2021a","abstract":"Infection intensity can dictate disease outcomes but is typically ignored when modeling infection dynamics of microparasites (e.g., bacteria, virus, and fungi). However, for a number of pathogens of wildlife typically categorized as microparasites, accounting for infection intensity and within-host infection processes is critical for predicting population-level responses to pathogen invasion. Here, we develop a modeling framework we refer to as reduceddimension host-parasite integral projection models (reduced IPMs) that we use to explore how within-host infection processes affect the dynamics of pathogen invasion and virulence evolution. We ﬁnd that individual-level heterogeneity in pathogen load—a nearly ubiquitous characteristic of host-parasite interactions that is rarely considered in models of microparasites—generally reduces pathogen invasion probability and dampens virulence-transmission trade-offs in host-parasite systems. The latter effect likely contributes to widely predicted virulence-transmission trade-offs being difﬁcult to observe empirically. Moreover, our analyses show that intensity-dependent host mortality does not always induce a virulence-transmission tradeoff, and systems with steeper than linear relationships between pathogen intensity and host mortality rate are signiﬁcantly more likely to exhibit these trade-offs. Overall, reduced IPMs provide a useful framework to expand our theoretical and data-driven understanding of how within-host processes affect population-level disease dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilber","given":"Mark Q."},{"family":"Pfab","given":"Ferdinand"},{"family":"Ohmer","given":"Michel E."},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Cheryl J."}],"citation-key":"wilber2021a","container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/716914","ISSN":"0003-0147, 1537-5323","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"661-677","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Integrating infection intensity into within- and between-host pathogen dynamics: implications for invasion and virulence evolution","title-short":"Integrating infection intensity into within- and between-host pathogen dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/716914","volume":"198"},

This study quantiﬁes the possible impact of climate change on ﬁre regimes by estimating changes in ﬁre weather and the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FDI), an index that is used throughout Australia to estimate ﬁre danger. The CSIRO 9-level general circulation model (CSIRO9 GCM) is used to simulate daily and seasonal ﬁre danger for the present Australian climate and for a doubledCO2 climate. The impact assessment includes validation of the GCMs daily control simulation and the derivation of ‘correction factors’ which improve the accuracy of the ﬁre danger simulation. In summary, the general impact of doubled-CO2 is to increase ﬁre danger at all sites by increasing the number of days of very high and extreme ﬁre danger.

  {"id":"winner2018","abstract":"Despite the routine nature of estimating overlapping space use in ecological research, to date no formal inferential framework for home range overlap has been available to ecologists. Part of this issue is due to the inherent difficulty of comparing the estimated home ranges that underpin overlap across individuals, studies, sites, species, and times. As overlap is calculated conditionally on a pair of home range estimates, biases in these estimates will propagate into biases in overlap estimates. Further compounding the issue of comparability in home range estimators is the historical lack of confidence intervals on overlap estimates. This means that it is not currently possible to determine if a set of overlap values is statistically different from one another. As a solution, we develop the first rigorous inferential framework for home range overlap. Our framework is based on the autocorrelated-Kernel density estimation (AKDE) family of home range estimators, which correct for biases due to autocorrelation, small effective sample size, and irregular sampling in time. Collectively, these advances allow AKDE estimates to validly be compared even when sampling strategies differ. We then couple the AKDE estimates with a novel bias-corrected Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) to quantify overlap. Finally, we propagate uncertainty in the AKDE estimates through to overlap and thus are able to put confidence intervals on the BC point estimate. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how our inferential framework provides accurate overlap estimates, and reasonable coverage of the true overlap, even at small sample sizes. When applied to empirical data, we found that building an interaction network for Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa based on all possible ties, vs. only those ties with statistical support, substantially influenced the network’s properties and any potential biological inferences derived from it. Our inferential framework permits researchers to calculate overlap estimates that can validly be compared across studies, sites, species, and times, and test whether observed differences are statistically meaningful. This method is available via the R package ctmm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Winner","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Noonan","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Christen H."},{"family":"Olson","given":"Kirk A."},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Sheldon","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Calabrese","given":"Justin M."}],"citation-key":"winner2018","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13027","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"1679-1691","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Statistical inference for home range overlap","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13027","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"wolfe2018","abstract":"Context Translocation as a tool for management of nuisance or ‘problem’ snakes near urban areas is currently used worldwide with limited success. Translocated snakes experience modified behaviours, spatial use and survivorship, and few studies have investigated the impacts of translocation within a metropolitan area. Aims In the present study, we investigated the impacts of translocation on the most commonly encountered snake in Perth Western Australia, the dugite (Pseudonaja affinis, Elapidae), by comparing the space use of resident and translocated snakes. Methods We captured 10 dugites and attached telemetry packages, composed of a radio-telemetry transmitter and global positioning system (GPS) data-logger, externally to their tails. Snakes were either released within 200 m of their initial capture sites (residents, n = 6) or moved to new unconnected habitat at least 3 km away (translocated, n = 4). Spatial-use data were analysed using general linear models to identify differences between resident and translocated dugites. Key results Translocation influenced space use of dugites and detrimentally affected their survivorship. Translocated snakes had larger activity ranges than did residents, and there was a trend towards travelling greater distances over time. Mortality for all snakes was high: 100% for translocated snakes, and 50% for residents. Conclusions Urban dugites face many threats, and snakes were negatively affected by translocation. The GPS technology we used did not improve the quality of the data over traditional radio-telemetry methods, owing to the cryptic nature of the snakes that spent much of their time under cover or underground. Implications These findings support the growing body of evidence that translocating ‘problem’ snakes is a not a humane method of animal management, and alternatives such as public education, may be more appropriate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Ashleigh K."},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Bateman","given":"Philip W."},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Ashleigh K."},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Bateman","given":"Philip W."}],"citation-key":"wolfe2018","container-title":"Wildlife Research","container-title-short":"Wildl.

Mortalities associated with these declines have often occurred during cooler seasons and at high elevations, suggesting that environmental temperature may be an important factor in disease emergence. We found that thermal environment affects the progress of the disease, and that housing frogs Litoria chloris at an environmental temperature of 37°C for less than 16 h can clear them of the chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Our experiment demonstrated that elevated body temperatures similar to those experienced in behavioral fever and during normal thermoregulation can clear frogs of chytrid infection; therefore, variation in thermoregulatory opportunities and behaviors are likely to contribute to the differences in disease incidence observed among host species, populations, and regions. Although further refinement of the technique is needed to encompass various host species, appropriately applied thermal manipulations of amphibians and their enclosures may prove to be a safe and effective way of eliminating the fungal pathogen from captive amphibian populations and preventing accidental spread of the pathogen when animals are translocated or released from captivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Woodhams","given":"Douglas C."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Marantelli","given":"Gerry"}],"citation-key":"woodhams2003","container-title":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","DOI":"10.3354/dao055065","ISSN":"0177-5103, 1616-1580","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"65-67","source":"Crossref","title":"Emerging disease of amphibians cured by elevated body temperature","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v55/n1/p65-67/","volume":"55"},
  {"id":"woodhams2005","abstract":"Abstract: In the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia, eight species of stream-dwelling frogs have experienced population declines. Some declines were associated with an emerging infectious disease of amphibians (chytridiomycosis) caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We examined the spatial and temporal pattern of infection prevalence in a sample of frog populations. Infected adults and tadpoles of all species were found, and infections occurred at every site. Infection prevalence varied among species and was always < 10.0% in adults but ranged from 0.75 to 76.0% in tadpoles. In this system tadpoles and adults of some species may act as disease reservoirs, experiencing avirulent infections, whereas other hosts (declining species) experience virulent infections. Infection prevalence was higher during the cool, dry winter season (May to September) and at high elevations (600–800 m), suggesting regulation by environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation. We found no relationships between infection prevalence and mean body condition, fluctuating asymmetry of hind limbs, population density, or the presence of metamorphosing tadpoles and juvenile frogs. Although it is not certain whether chytridiomycosis was responsible for past frog population declines in the wet tropics of Queensland, the pathogen is now endemic. Our data indicate that at the landscape level, environmental conditions have strong effects on host-pathogen dynamics. These effects interact with species-specific behavior or immune function and may be important underlying determinants of chytridiomycosis epizootics and emergence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Woodhams","given":"Douglas C."},{"family":"Alford","given":"Ross A."}],"citation-key":"woodhams2005","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.004403.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"1449-1459","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ecology of chytridiomycosis in rainforest stream frog assemblages of tropical Queensland","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.004403.x","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"woodhams2007","abstract":"Innate immune mechanisms of defense are especially important to ectothermic vertebrates in which adaptive immune responses may be slow to develop. One innate defense in amphibian skin is the release of abundant quantities of antimicrobial peptides. Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians caused by the skin fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Susceptibility to chytridiomycosis varies among species, and mechanisms of disease resistance are not well understood. Previously, we have shown that Australian and Panamanian amphibian species that possess skin peptides that effectively inhibit the growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro tend to survive better in the wild or are predicted to survive the ﬁrst encounter with this lethal pathogen. For most species, it has been difﬁcult to experimentally infect individuals with B. dendrobatidis and directly evaluate both survival and antimicrobial peptide defenses. Here, we demonstrate differences in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis among four Australian species (Litoria caerulea, Litoria chloris, Mixophyes fasciolatus and Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) after experimental infection with B. dendrobatidis, and show that the survival rate increases with the in vitro effectiveness of the skin peptides. We also observed that circulating granulocyte, but not lymphocyte, counts differed between infected and uninfected Lit. chloris. This suggests that innate granulocyte defenses may be activated by pathogen exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that multiple innate defense mechanisms are involved in resistance to chytridiomycosis, and the efﬁcacy of these defenses varies by amphibian species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Woodhams","given":"D.

Population declines associated with chytridiomycosis emergence were detected at Altos de Campana National Park.

Precise predictions of future disease emergence events are not possible until factors underlying disease emergence, such as dispersal, are understood. However, if the fungal pathogen spreads in a pattern consistent with previous disease events in Panama, then detection of Bd at Tortı´ and other areas east of the Panama Canal is imminent.

  {"id":"woodhams2011","abstract":"Background: Rescuing amphibian diversity is an achievable conservation challenge. Disease mitigation is one essential component of population management. Here we assess existing disease mitigation strategies, some in early experimental stages, which focus on the globally emerging chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We discuss the precedent for each strategy in systems ranging from agriculture to human medicine, and the outlook for each strategy in terms of research needs and long-term potential.\nResults: We find that the effects of exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis occur on a spectrum from transient commensal to lethal pathogen. Management priorities are divided between (1) halting pathogen spread and developing survival assurance colonies, and (2) prophylactic or remedial disease treatment. Epidemiological models of chytridiomycosis suggest that mitigation strategies can control disease without eliminating the pathogen. Ecological ethics guide wildlife disease research, but several ethical questions remain for managing disease in the field.\nConclusions: Because sustainable conservation of amphibians in nature is dependent on long-term population persistence and co-evolution with potentially lethal pathogens, we suggest that disease mitigation not focus exclusively on the elimination or containment of the pathogen, or on the captive breeding of amphibian hosts. Rather, successful disease mitigation must be context specific with epidemiologically informed strategies to manage already infected populations by decreasing pathogenicity and host susceptibility. We propose population level treatments based on three steps: first, identify mechanisms of disease suppression; second, parameterize epizootiological models of disease and population dynamics for testing under semi-natural conditions; and third, begin a process of adaptive management in field trials with natural populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Woodhams","given":"Douglas C."},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Cheryl J."},{"family":"Cashins","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Leyla R."},{"family":"Lauer","given":"Antje"},{"family":"Muths","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Puschendorf","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Benedikt R."},{"family":"Sheafor","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Voyles","given":"Jamie"}],"citation-key":"woodhams2011","container-title":"Frontiers in Zoology","DOI":"10.1186/1742-9994-8-8","ISSN":"1742-9994","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Crossref","title":"Mitigating amphibian disease: strategies to maintain wild populations and control chytridiomycosis","title-short":"Mitigating amphibian disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-8-8","volume":"8"},

Desirable protocols are species, life stage, and context specific, but currently few treatment options exist for amphibians infected with the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Treatment options, at present, include antifungal drugs and heat therapy, but risks of toxicity and sideeffects make these options untenable in some cases. Here, we report on the comparison of several novel treatments with a more generally accepted antifungal treatment in experimental scientific trials to treat Bd-infected frogs including Alytes obstetricans tadpoles and metamorphs, Bufo bufo and Limnodynastes peronii metamorphs, and Lithobates pipiens and Rana muscosa adults. The experimental treatments included commercial antifungal products (itraconazole, mandipropamid, steriplantN, and PIP Pond Plus), antimicrobial skin peptides from the Bd-resistant Pelophylax esculentus, microbial treatments (Pedobacter cryoconitis), and heat therapy (35°C for 24 h). None of the new experimental treatments were considered successful in terms of improving survival; however, these results may advance future research by indicating the limits and potential of the various protocols. Caution in the use of itraconazole is warranted because of observed toxicity in metamorphic and adult frogs, even at low concentrations. Results suggest that rather than focusing on a single cure-all, diverse lines of research may provide multiple options for treating Bd infection in amphibians.

  {"id":"wuerthner2017","abstract":"Summary Coinfections are increasingly recognized as important drivers of disease dynamics. Consequently, greater emphasis has been placed on integrating principles from community ecology with disease ecology to understand within-host interactions among parasites. Using larval amphibians and two amphibian parasites (ranaviruses and the trematode Echinoparyphium sp.), we examined the influence of coinfection on disease outcomes. Our first objective was to examine how priority effects (the timing and sequence of parasite exposure) influence infection and disease outcomes in the laboratory. We found that interactions between the parasites were asymmetric; prior infection with Echinoparyphium reduced ranaviral loads by 9% but there was no reciprocal effect of prior ranavirus infection on Echinoparyphium load. Additionally, survival rates of hosts (larval gray treefrogs; Hyla versicolor) infected with Echinoparyphium 10 days prior to virus exposure were 25% greater compared to hosts only exposed to virus. Our second objective was to determine whether these patterns were generalizable to multiple amphibian species under more natural conditions. We conducted a semi-natural mesocosm experiment consisting of four larval amphibian hosts [gray treefrogs, American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer)] to examine how prior Echinoparyphium infection influenced ranavirus transmission within the community, using ranavirus-infected larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) as source of ranavirus. Consistent with the laboratory experiment, we found that prior Echinoparyphium infection reduced ranaviral loads by 19 to 28% in three of the four species. Collectively, these results suggest that macroparasite infection can reduce microparasite replication rates across multiple amphibian species, possibly through cross-reactive immunity. Although the immunological mechanisms driving this outcome are in need of further study, trematode infections appear to benefit hosts that are exposed to ranaviruses. Additionally, these results suggest that consideration of priority effects and timing of exposure are vital for understanding parasite interactions within hosts and disease outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Wuerthner","given":"Vanessa P."},{"family":"Hua","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Hoverman","given":"Jason T."}],"citation-key":"wuerthner2017","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.12665","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,1]]},"page":"921-931","source":"besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au (Atypon)","title":"The benefits of coinfection: trematodes alter disease outcomes associated with virus infection","title-short":"The benefits of coinfection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.scu.edu.au/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12665","volume":"86"},

Here, we discuss an alternative approach to discrete latent states, marginalization, that forms the basis of maximum likelihood population models and is much faster. Our manuscript has two goals: (1) to introduce readers unfamiliar with marginalization to the concept and provide worked examples and (2) to address topics associated with marginalization that have not been previously synthesized and are relevant to both Bayesian and maximum likelihood models. We begin by explaining marginalization using a CormackJolly-Seber model. Next, we apply marginalization to multistate capture–recapture, community occupancy, and integrated population models and briefly discuss random effects, priors, and pseudo-R2. Then, we focus on recovery of discrete latent states, defining different types of conditional probabilities and showing how quantities such as population abundance or species richness can be estimated in marginalized code. Last, we show that occupancy and site-abundance models with auto-covariates can be fit with marginalized code with minimal impact on parameter estimates. Marginalized code was anywhere from five to >1,000 times faster than discrete code and differences in inferences were minimal. Discrete latent states and fully conditional approaches provide the best estimates of conditional probabilities for a given site or individual. However, estimates for parameters and derived quantities such as species richness and abundance are minimally affected by marginalization. In the case of abundance, marginalized code is both quicker and has lower bias than an N-augmentation approach. Understanding how marginalization works shrinks the divide between Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to population models. Some models that have only been presented in a Bayesian framework can easily be fit in maximum likelihood. On the other hand, factors such as informative priors, random effects, or pseudo-R2 values may motivate a Bayesian approach in some applications. An understanding of marginalization allows users to minimize the speed that is sacrificed when switching from a maximum likelihood approach. Widespread application of marginalization in Bayesian population models will facilitate more thorough simulation studies, comparisons of alternative model structures, and faster learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Yackulic","given":"Charles B."},{"family":"Dodrill","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Dzul","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Sanderlin","given":"Jamie S."},{"family":"Reid","given":"Janice A."}],"citation-key":"yackulic2020","container-title":"Ecological Applications","container-title-short":"Ecol Appl","DOI":"10.1002/eap.2112","ISSN":"1051-0761, 1939-5582","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A need for speed in Bayesian population models: a practical guide to marginalizing and recovering discrete latent states","title-short":"A need for speed in Bayesian population models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2112","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"zhang2022","abstract":"Multivariate spatially oriented data sets are prevalent in the environmental and physical sciences. Scientists seek to jointly model multiple variables, each indexed by a spatial location, to capture any underlying spatial association for each variable and associations among the different dependent variables. Multivariate latent spatial process models have proved effective in driving statistical inference and rendering better predictive inference at arbitrary locations for the spatial process. High-dimensional multivariate spatial data, which are the theme of this article, refer to data sets where the number of spatial locations and the number of spatially dependent variables is very large. The field has witnessed substantial developments in scalable models for univariate spatial processes, but such methods for multivariate spatial processes, especially when the number of outcomes are moderately large, are limited in comparison. Here, we extend scalable modeling strategies for a single process to multivariate processes. We pursue Bayesian inference, which is attractive for full uncertainty quantification of the latent spatial process. Our approach exploits distribution theory for the matrix-normal distribution, which we use to construct scalable versions of a hierarchical linear model of coregionalization (LMC) and spatial factor models that deliver inference over a high-dimensional parameter space including the latent spatial process. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of our algorithms over competing methods using simulation studies and an analysis of a massive vegetation index data set.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Sudipto"}],"citation-key":"zhang2022","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/biom.13452","ISSN":"1541-0420","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"560-573","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Spatial factor modeling: A Bayesian matrix-normal approach for misaligned data","title-short":"Spatial factor modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13452","volume":"78"},

  {"id":"zipkin2010","abstract":"Conservation and management actions often have direct and indirect effects on a wide range of species. As such, it is important to evaluate the impacts that such actions may have on both target and non-target species within a region. Understanding how species richness and composition differ as a result of management treatments can help determine potential ecological consequences. Yet it is difﬁcult to estimate richness because traditional sampling approaches detect species at variable rates and some species are never observed. We present a framework for assessing management actions on biodiversity using a multi-species hierarchical model that estimates individual species occurrences, while accounting for imperfect detection of species. Our model incorporates species-speciﬁc responses to management treatments and local vegetation characteristics and a hierarchical component that links species at a community-level. This allows for comprehensive inferences on the whole community or on assemblages of interest. Compared to traditional species models, occurrence estimates are improved for all species, even for those that are rarely observed, resulting in more precise estimates of species richness (including species that were unobserved during sampling). We demonstrate the utility of this approach for conservation through an analysis comparing bird communities in two geographically similar study areas: one in which white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities have been regulated through hunting and one in which deer densities have gone unregulated. Although our results indicate that species and assemblage richness were similar in the two study areas, point-level richness was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by local vegetation characteristics, a result that would have been underestimated had we not accounted for variability in species detection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Zipkin","given":"Elise F."},{"family":"Andrew Royle","given":"J."},{"family":"Dawson","given":"Deanna K."},{"family":"Bates","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"zipkin2010","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2009.11.016","ISSN":"00063207","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"language":"en","page":"479-484","source":"Crossref","title":"Multi-species occurrence models to evaluate the effects of conservation and management actions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320709004819","volume":"143"},

In Central America, most of the 34 species of the Craugastor punctariolus species group have disappeared in recent years in high- and low-elevation rainforests. Distribution models for B. dendrobatidis and the continuous presence of the extirpated stream-dwelling species, Craugastor ranoides, in the driest site of Costa Rica (Santa Elena Peninsula), suggest that environmental conditions might restrict the growth and development of B. dendrobatidis, existing as a refuge from chytridiomycosis-driven extinction. We conducted ﬁeld surveys to detect and quantify the pathogen using Real-time PCR in samples from 15 species of frogs in two locations of tropical dry forest. In Santa Elena Peninsula, we swabbed 310 frogs, and only one sample of the species, C. ranoides, tested positive for B. dendrobatidis (prevalence <0.1%). In Santa Rosa Station, we swabbed 100 frogs, and nine samples from three species tested positive (prevalence = 9.0%). We failed to detect signs of chytridiomycosis in any of the 410 sampled frogs, and low quantities of genetic equivalents (between 0 and 1073) were obtained from the ten positive samples. The difference in the prevalence between locations might be due not only to the hotter and drier conditions of Santa Elena Peninsula but also to the different compositions of species in both locations. Our results suggest that B. dendrobatidis is at the edge of its distribution in these dry and hot environments of tropical dry forest. This study supports the existence of climatic refuges from chytridiomycosis and highlights the importance of tropical dry forest conservation for amphibians in the face of epidemic disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zumbado-Ulate","given":"Héctor"},{"family":"Bolaños","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Gutiérrez-Espeleta","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Puschendorf","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"zumbado-ulate2014","container-title":"EcoHealth","DOI":"10.1007/s10393-014-0967-2","ISSN":"1612-9202, 1612-9210","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12]]},"language":"en","page":"593-602","source":"Crossref","title":"Extremely low prevalence of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in frog populations from neotropical dry forest of Costa Rica supports the existence of a climatic refuge from disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10393-014-0967-2","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"zylstra2019","abstract":"Understanding how natural and anthropogenic processes affect population dynamics of species with patchy distributions is critical to predicting their responses to environmental changes. Despite considerable evidence that demographic rates and dispersal patterns vary temporally in response to an array of biotic and abiotic processes, few applications of metapopulation theory have sought to explore factors that explain spatiotemporal variation in extinction or colonization rates. To facilitate exploring these factors, we extended a spatially explicit model of metapopulation dynamics to create a framework that requires only binary presence–absence data, makes few assumptions about the dispersal process, and accounts for imperfect detection. We apply this framework to 22 yr of biannual survey data for lowland leopard frogs, Lithobates yavapaiensis, an amphibian that inhabits arid stream systems in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for factors that govern temporal variation in transition probabilities, as both extinction and colonization rates varied with hydrologic conditions. Specifically, local extinctions were more frequent during drought periods, particularly at sites without reliable surface water. Colonization rates increased when larval and dispersal periods were wetter than normal, which increased the probability that potential emigrants metamorphosed and reached neighboring sites. Extirpation of frogs from all sites in one watershed during a period of severe drought demonstrated the influence of site-level features, as frogs persisted only in areas where most sites held water consistently and where the amount of sediment deposited from high-elevation wildfires was low. Application of our model provided novel insights into how climaterelated processes affected the distribution and population dynamics of an arid-land amphibian. The approach we describe has application to a wide array of species that inhabit patchy environments, can improve our understanding of factors that govern metapopulation dynamics, and can inform strategies for conservation of imperiled species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zylstra","given":"Erin R."},{"family":"Swann","given":"Don E."},{"family":"Hossack","given":"Blake R."},{"family":"Muths","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Steidl","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"zylstra2019","container-title":"Ecological Applications","container-title-short":"Ecol Appl","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1859","ISSN":"1051-0761, 1939-5582","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","page":"e01859","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Drought‐mediated extinction of an arid‐land amphibian: insights from a spatially explicit dynamic occupancy model","title-short":"Drought‐mediated extinction of an arid‐land amphibian","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1859","volume":"29"}
